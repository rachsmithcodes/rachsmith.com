  Is it cheating if your first post for Weblog Posting Month is about how you're
  partaking in Weblog Posting Month?

I haven't posted many notes here of late. It's not like I've had writer's block or have been struggling with perfectionism. It's just amongst the juggle of all the different priorities, responsibilities and interests I have, I've dropped the "writing for this website" ball.

I need a kickstart to get back in to the habit of sharing. Which is why I'm joining the #WeblogPoMo2024 challenge posed by [Apple Annie / @anniegreens](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024).

As for a theme/topic for the month, I'll go with "whatever interests me", where I'll attempt to write about whatever has been holding my interest that day. It's probably about to get really random around here. Will you join me?
