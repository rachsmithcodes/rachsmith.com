Today my son saw a [Marshmello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshmello) clip on Spotify and asked why he was wearing the marshmallow helmet. I explained that some artists like to wear a mask to keep their actual identity private, but then later I thought about the how I didn't actually know if this is the case for Marshmello. After looking it up, it seems like this was an original motivation for the mask, although his actual identity has been revealed. It got me thinking about other artists I like that wear things over their head. 

This is my favourite Marshmello song, by the way.

When I think about DJ's with things on their head, I can't go past Deadmau5, who I found out today was a major inspiration for Marshmello's helmet. Can you believe I was listening to Deadmau5 and reading his name as "Dead-mao-five" in my head for like all of 2008 before I heard someone else pronounce it? I mean the mask is a freaking mouse! Anyway, this is my favourite Deadmau5 song. It still slaps.

I of course have to mention the robots who started it all: Daft Punk. It is really hard to pick a favourite song, but I'll choose One More Time just because I have many fond memories of my oldest dancing around to it when he was a toddler. He LOVED that song. Also the entire TRON: Legacy Soundtrack is so good.

A bonus Artist/Song: This Bloody Beetroots track and video is the most 2009 thing ever. Also, did you know that Steve Aoki's dad is the founder of Benihana?
