On a recent Saturday evening it was my turn to do the post-dinner cleanup. I'd run out of comedy/pop culture podcasts to listen to, but I had just polished off a spicy marg and listening to [Dr. Andrew Huberman](https://www.hubermanlab.com/podcast) spout health facts was absolutely not the vibe. So I chucked on some trending pop music and had a little dance party on my own while I wiped down surfaces and swept up food scraps. It was awesome!

I loved listening to music back in the old days before podcasts were a thing. I would do it all the time in my 20s. I would buy CDs and then songs from iTunes. When Spotify came around, I would carefully craft playlists and diligently download the tracks for when I was on the go.

In 2014, I found podcasts (along with almost everyone else), and instead of having a soundtrack follow me around while I did chores, went to the gym or rode on public transport, I had podcasts. Podcasts have elevated my life. I've learnt so much from them, laughed, cried and everything in between. The more casual, chatty ones feel like having a couple of friends in my ears. 

I think, though, with all the podcast listening, I'd forgotten how much I enjoy music. Lately, I've been trying to reduce the stimulation/information intake in my everyday life, so I've been doing more listening to music and less listening to podcasts. It is a bit like falling in love again.

If you're interested, here are my disco dishes songs. My taste in music expands across many genres, but I'm a basic bitch at heart and can't go past a standard pop banger.
