I was worried I would very quickly run out of things to write about when I first started on [#WeblogPoMo2024](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024), but it turns out if I make myself produce *something* every day, I find the words.

I'm finding there's something to having a default thing to do with any spare bit of time each day. I have a lot of creative interests: writing, piano, lettering, drawing, creative coding... I like to flit between them to "keep things interesting" but more often than not the mental effort to pick one of them when I have a spare moment causes me to procrastinate and do something like watch YouTube instead. 

This month, writing just has to come first. If I stay on the course, I will have published 31 notes. That's 60% of my rough goal of 50 notes this year, all in the space of one month! I'm thinking this could be the start of a rolling monthly challenge for myself. I could pick an activity to do every day for the month, and make some real progress towards that hobby. 

I watched [a new tutorial from iPad Lettering with Karin Newport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p_PH7flNnQ&pp=ygUPaXBhZCBsZXR0ZXJpbmcg) yesterday, and got excited at the thought that June could be a month of doing lettering every day.

Love that I'm only 7 days in to this challenge and I'm already thinking about the next one. Like, calm down ðŸ˜‚. Let's see if I can complete May first!
