If you're looking for some personal site inspiration, look no further than [lynnandtonic.com](https://lynnandtonic.com). Lynn is possibly the most prolific CSS artist on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/lynnandtonic). Each year she redesigns her website with something extremely clever and novel. They remind me of the times before [all websites looked the same](https://www.fastcompany.com/90501691/science-confirms-it-web-sites-really-do-all-look-the-same), but with modern tech and polish.
