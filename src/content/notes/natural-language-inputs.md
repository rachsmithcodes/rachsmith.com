As I read this it occurred to me that I gravitate toward applications that support natural language input.

I pay an exorbitant subscription fee for [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) because of the natural language input.

My go-to reminders app, [Due](https://www.dueapp.com/) has natural language input.

I recently ditched my much-loved task manager [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) for Todoist, because of their natural language input!

Now I'm so used to having a text input that understands what I want, I have very little patience for fiddling with complicated input UI.
