**Update:** The stack for this blog has changed a little. It no longer uses Ghost to store the content. The content is now stored within the Gatsby `src`. [Read more here](/10000-gatsby-develops-later/).

## The Stack

The best way to procrastinate on writing for your new blog is to deliberate over choosing the tech stack for your new blog. Especially if you are a capable cross-stack Web Developer, as the options to choose from may as well be infinite.

I’ve been wanting to give the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) a try for years now, so was hoping to find a Jamstack solution. The number one requirement was that it wouldn’t take long for me to get up and running. After doing some research I found [this blog post](https://emtr0.dev/how-to-set-up-free-jamstack-ghost-blog-heroku-gatsby-github-netlify/) that gave a step-by-step process of how to set up a blog using Ghost and Gatsby. Within an hour I had a blog up and running.

The setup is:

- A [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) (Node) backend running on a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) Dyno.
- A [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) Front-End hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) that uses Ghost's GraphQL API to provide the blog data.

Once I completed the initial setup, I just needed to modify the React and CSS provided by [this starter theme](https://github.com/TryGhost/gatsby-starter-ghost) to make it my own. All the code for the front end [is in this repo](https://github.com/rachsmithcodes/rachsmith.com).

One of the pleasant things about this setup is that you can run it all for free. You need to pay if you want an always-on Dyno running Ghost, but I like that having a basic portfolio/blog is accessible to unemployed or Junior Developers who are short on cash.

## Drafting and editing

As I am pretty time poor at the moment, I tap a lot of my initial drafts out on my phone while the baby feeds in 10+ minute increments. Then when I have a bit of time to sit down on the MacBook, I edit and copy the final version over to Ghost.

My original workflow was:

- using [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) for writing
- editing for spelling and grammar in [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/)
- converting to markdown and publishing on Ghost
  It felt clunky, as I would prefer to write in markdown from the start.

I have recently started a new workflow:

- I write in [iaWriter](https://ia.net/writer) (amazing)
- proof in [ProWritingAid](https://prowritingaid.com/Premium) (very promising, can handle markdown)
- publishing on Ghost
