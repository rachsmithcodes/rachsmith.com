Life has been life-ing. With everything going on I fell off the habit of tracking my activities in [Chronicling](/chronicling/), (as well as doing a lot of activites, see below). And then I totally missed the September month note. The completionist in me is absolutely \*triggered\* by this. So the only way to move forward is to declare bankruptcy on the numbers front and resolve to get back on track in November.

## Notable

### The Good

**School holidays** and a family trip to the Gold Coast. We went to one of those holiday park places where they have pools with slides and a splash park and a bouncing pillow. Will definitely be doing that again.

**11th wedding anniversary** ðŸ’•.

**Working on my [Home-cooked web apps](/home-cooked-web-apps/)**. Still really enjoying this.

### The Bad

**Toilet training** our youngest. The worst.

**Two seperate gastro viruses** going through the family. Actually the worst. 

**I sprained my ankle** really badly, while on a run. Absolutely devastating because I had just got to the point where I could regularly run again, after rehabbing a hamstring injury all year. I couldn't even do my [stupid walk for my stupid mental health](https://www.tiktok.com/@grandadjoe1933/video/7214155219821808901?lang=en) for two full weeks. I'm hanging in there but the wheels are starting to fall off the bus! 

## Work

Spent the last 2 months working with our payment processors (Stripe and Braintree) and attempting to fix some past mistakes in our legacy billing code. Working with third-party APIs is my least favourite part of development and I'm ready for it to be finished!

**The work soundtrack:** [Is This Love ? Radio](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E8Oe9ZsVJHdN4?si=2b4b38afcfbf46ea)

## Watched

- [The Perfect Couple](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11514868/): didn't finish this. It was too similar to White Lotus but without any of the charm.
- [The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5788792/): Finished season 5. Genuinely funny show with great character development. A real gem.
- [English Teacher](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt20782190/): Cute comedy. Loved it. I've been watching Brian Jordan Alvarez on TikTok for years. 
- [Only Murders in the Building](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11691774/) Season 4: Not as good as Season 3, but this show is still my favourite comfort watch.
