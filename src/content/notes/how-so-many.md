Something I think about often: how does [Anh Do](https://www.anhdo.com/) write so many books in such a short span of time?

Some context for overseas readers: Anh Do is an Australian artist who started out his media career as a comedian, but has also had another career as a children’s books writer. He also [learnt how to paint really well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddBQ7q6LRMg&list=PLsPVOdZ3LN6fUf0uwf5j6Ls_Df3pAjWMQ) along the way. 

He seems to me to be one of those people who just ends up exceptional at whatever he chooses to do. He must work really, really hard but I would also love to know more about his process. 

He has started no less than 10 book series since 2013. Since 2020 he's released almost 50 books! These are not short children’s books either. They are junior novels, taking anywhere between 20 minutes to over an hour to read aloud.

It's not like the books are garbage either. They are very popular for good reason. My kids love them!

He has to at this point be Australia's most prolific children's author. And yet I find so little on the internet written about this. No profiles or interviews. I'm guessing he must choose to be private and not do the publicity thing. Probably too busy writing books!!
