## Notable

**#WeblogPoMo2024**. I added a note every day this month. It was sometimes a squeeze to get a post up, but I think I did less procrastination and time-wasting overall this month. 

**I was thinking a lot about ways to move more**. I considered buying a walking pad for my standing desk but I've been working on just standing more instead.

**I had a really great Mother's Day weekend**. I organised a night out with some friends. It's out of my comfort zone to be the organiser of such a thing, but it was a great night and I was so glad I did it.

**I started volunteering for our School's P&F.** It's the first time in a long time I've felt like I've had the capacity to do anything like this outside of my day job and my family, so that feels good.

## Work

Still(!) working on the Permissions implementation for our new CodePen Editor. 

**The work soundtrack:** [Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga (Music from the Netflix Film)](https://open.spotify.com/album/0u6ppFo3gWA3vTiGeDTWXl?si=HMR-pnJMTT6JUPCWi-er6A)

## Watched

We started on [Marvelous Mrs Maisel](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5788792/). It's pretty good so far!

## Read

I'm slowly getting through [Mistborn: The Final Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistborn:_The_Final_Empire). I'm enjoying it! Enjoying it so much that I keep staying up too late to read a little more. It's problematic.

## The numbers
