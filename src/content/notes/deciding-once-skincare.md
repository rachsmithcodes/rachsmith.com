Kendra Adachi's [The Lazy Genius Way](https://www.thelazygeniuscollective.com/book) outlines 13 principles to simplify your approach to life. Of all the principles, my favourite has to be "decide once". The idea is that you make a decision about something, and drop any ideas of revisiting that decision.

My brain loves to solve problems. That's what my mind spends most of its time doing. The problematic part is that my brain loves to solve any problem, even trivial ones. I waste brain cycles on things that simply do not need to be thought about. That's why Kendra Adachi's "decide once" principle spoke to me. There are problems that I can consider solved and not think about again.

Something I've decided once on is skincare and cosmetics. I have my moisturizer, exfoliant, serums, sunscreen, CC cream, concealer, mascara, bronzer, blush and mascara all decided on. When one of them runs out I buy a new one of the same product.

It is hard to overstate how much money and time I spent in my teens and twenties "deciding" what makeup and skincare I would use. So much of my attention given to the $100 billion-dollar beauty industry and for very little benefit to me! It's a damn shame.

Thanks to "decide once" I can ignore every ad I see or hear about the latest cosmetic or skincare because "what should I use on my face?" is a solved problem.
