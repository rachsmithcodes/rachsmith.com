Look, coding is hard. Every time you start to solve a problem or fix a bug you run the risk of not being able to do it and then feeling like you aren't as smart as you thought you were. That sucks! Here are some things you can do instead.

## Choose a new font for your IDE
My paid favourites are [Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/), [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/styles) and [Dank Mono](https://philpl.gumroad.com/l/dank-mono). But there is a whole set of [free monospace fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Monospace) on Google Fonts that you can try out, one by one until you find one you like, or don't.

## Change your terminal
I've heard [warp](https://www.warp.dev/) is good?

## Choose a new theme for your IDE
Some of my favourites: [Moonlight II](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=atomiks.moonlight), [In Bed By 7pm](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.inbedby7pm) and [Houston](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.houston). But there are [hundreds](https://vscodethemes.com/) (thousands?) of options to choose from. Try them out. Use each for half an hour before you decide to change back to the same one you've had for the last 3 years.

## Decide you're going to learn all the keyboard shortcuts in VSCode
Pretend you're improving your productivity when you're actually procrastinating! Check out the [Keybindings reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings) or if you're too lazy for that, watch some videos on people's[ favourite VSCode shortcuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xA5JePvCJc).

## Buy a new keyboard
Your code is going to be so much better when you have the ultimate keyboard. Research is important so make sure you head back to YouTube to find out [which is the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmQt-QM0mbQ&t=1s). Now instead of doing the work that makes you money, you are spending money. Amazing!

## Redesign your personal website
I mean it has been at least 6 months since you overhauled it. And the fact it doesn't include a dark/light theme switcher is frankly, embarrassing. Check out [other people's sites](https://personalsit.es/) for some inspo. Bonus: you can go back to Google Fonts!
