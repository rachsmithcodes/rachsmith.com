This is the third year in a row that I'm replacing my [NeuYear Sunday Monochrome Calendar](https://www.neuyear.net/collections/sunday-first/products/grayscale-large-wall-calendar?variant=44726886433070). I think I first heard about these on the [Focused](https://www.relay.fm/focused) podcast, being advertised as a productivity tool. Still, I bought it to help with my oldest kid.

My oldest was very aware of time from a young age. He knew all the days of the week and understood the concept of weeks and months. He was always asking what day it was, what was happening that day, what was happening that week. 

I got the big calendar and started colour coding and marking all the days - daycare days, grandparents' days, and swimming lesson days. We put a 'today' marker on some Blu Tack and moved it to its new spot daily. We've used it to learn all the month names, when the seasons start and finish, and when all our birthdays are. 

My oldest son LOVED the calendar, and it helped with giving him plenty of warning about changes in the usual routine and schedule. I also really enjoy seeing the entire year at a glance on the wall, especially since we are now at school and need to be aware of Term start and end dates, pupil-free days, and school event days. 

Due to currency conversion and shipping costs, this calendar is heinously expensive to get to me in Australia. But I can't find anything else like it. Let me know if you've seen calendars like this elsewhere!  

YMMV - my youngest is now the same age my oldest was when I first got the calendar. He couldn't care less what the days of the week are, what day it is today or what we have on for the week (or year). He just takes each day as it comes ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
