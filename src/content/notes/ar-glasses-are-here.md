I was listening to [Cal Newport's Deep Questions](https://www.calnewport.com/podcast/) podcast a while ago, and I was struck by his predictions for AR technology.

Cal describes a future where we end up with a set of AR glasses that:
- are unobtrusive and look good enough for people to be willing to wear them[^1]
- have a sufficient field of view and resolution where the image is comparable to viewing a real screen
- are connected to a wireless network that can stream high-resolution content (this infrastructure already exists in many places)

He suggests that such a pair of glasses will mean "the end of the consumer electronics industry as we know it."

This idea was so compelling to me. I am not interested in VR (the headsets make me ill), but AR glasses sound amazing. It seemed pretty futuristic though, like we'd be waiting a while to get it.

This week, my favourite tech review YouTuber [TechMeOut](https://www.youtube.com/techme0ut) shared a video reviewing a set of glasses that enables you to watch movies and shows without a screen.

It makes me think Apple has to be working on tech like this behind the scenes, right? They can't just be putting a new camera in the iPhone every year.

It's pretty wild to think about how a good set of glasses, [cloud development environments](https://dx.tips/the-end-of-localhost), and a fast internet connection could result in you *not needing a computer* to write code.

**Update: [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/2023/01/the_billions-dollar_vr_ar_headset_question)** thinks we have "15 or so years" before the AR glasses I'm dreaming of will be available on the market ðŸ˜­.

[^1]: I'm pretty sure the main reason [Google Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass) didn't do well with consumers is that they looked stupid.
