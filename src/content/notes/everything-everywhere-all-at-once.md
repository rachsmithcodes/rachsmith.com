When I was in year 9, I had to watch [The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix) for a school assignment. We watched many movies when I was a kid, including some sci-fi, but it wasn't really my thing. The Matrix stands out in my memory because I remember having the thought after I watched it:

*Wow, that is the coolest movie I have ever seen!*

I **LOVED** the Matrix. I don't recall any other movie gripping me quite like that one. I've liked other films and franchises that other people *loved*: [Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_films), [Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)), [Avatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)), [Inception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception), and [Interstellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)). They were all fine and enjoyable enough, but they didn't blow me away.

In the last eight years, I've barely taken notice of movies as they are released. For lifestyle reasons for sure, but I also have no interest in anything comic book or superhero related. It had been a long time since I had really enjoyed watching a movie.

Then I streamed [Everything Everywhere All At Once](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Everywhere_All_at_Once) and... I **LOVED** it. For the stunning visuals and sick action scenes, but also because I could relate to both Evelyn (the mother character) and Joy (the daughter character). Therefore I was far more emotionally invested in their journey than [Neo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_(The_Matrix))'s. 

All these years later, what a delight it is to have an experience again where I'm so excited about a movie. To finish it and have the thought: *wow, that is the coolest movie I have ever seen!*
