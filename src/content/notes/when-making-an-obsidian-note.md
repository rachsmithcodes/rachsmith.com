Like most apps, you can create a new file in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) by using the `command+n` keyboard shortcut. 

I like to use `command+o` though. This is the command to open the "quick switcher" find and open an existing file, and also provides the option to create a new file if you don't want to select an existing one.

If you don't want to open any of the files that come up with `command+o`, you can make a new one with the entered text by hitting `shift+enter`.

By creating files this way I can make sure I don't have a file that exists already with the same or similar name. It prevents the creation of duplicates.
