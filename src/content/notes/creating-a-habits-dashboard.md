I've been tracking habits and other personal stats in my [Obsidian daily notes](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes) for a few months now, using the [Dataview Plugin's inline field syntax](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/).

Once filled out, my personal tracking info looks something like this.

```markdown
## Tracking
---
sleep:: 7h10m
meditate:: y
journal:: y
walk:: y
yoga:: y
activity:: 3064
work:: -
food:: y
energy:: 4
mood:: 4
illness:: 0
write:: y
cycle:: n
```

I finally dug into doing something with this data using the [Dataview JS API](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/intro/) and I am pretty impressed with how powerful it is!

I created a script that:
- reads all the pages in the dailies folder
- uses the date of each to sort them into notes from the last 30 days, 60 days and 90 days
- figures out the percentage of days where I "completed" the habit from each time period
- renders out the percentages to a table

Now I can easily see which way my habits are trending: whether the last 30 days are following a positive or negative trajectory. 

Here's the full dataviewjs block. Hopefully, you'll be able to follow it if you're familiar with JavaScript. If not, feel free to ask me any questions.

```javascript
const now = new Date(Date.now()); 
const todayDate = dv.date(now.toISOString().slice(0, 10))

const habits = [
	{title: "7.5 hours sleep", prop: "sleep", condition: (v) => v.values.hours >= 7 && v.values.minutes >= 30},
	{ title: "80% nutrition", prop: 'food'},
	{ title: "Closed activity ring", prop: 'activity', condition: (v) => v > 2300},
	{ title: "Walk or Run", prop: 'walk'},
	{ title: "Yoga", prop: 'yoga'},
	{ title: "Meditate", prop: 'meditate'},
	{ title: "Journal", prop: 'journal'},
	{ title: "Write", prop: 'write'}
];

const timeScales = [30, 60, 90];
const timeScaleTitles = timeScales.map(days => `Last ${days} Days`);
const pages = dv.pages('"dailies"');

function dailyIsWithinDays(daily, days) {
	return dv.date(daily.file.name) >= (todayDate - dv.duration(`${days} days`));
}

const dailiesInTimeScale = timeScales.map(ts => pages.where(p => dailyIsWithinDays(p, ts)));

const habitRows = habits.map(habit => {
	const percentages = timeScales.map((ts, i) => {
		const dailies = dailiesInTimeScale[i];
		const habitCount = dailies.filter(p => {
			const value = p[habit.prop];
			if (!value) return false;
			if (habit.condition) return habit.condition(value)
			return value === 'y';
		}).length;
		return Math.round(habitCount/ts*100)
	});
	// add emoji to first percentage
	const percentageText = percentages.map((percentage, i) => {
		if (i === 0) {
			if (percentage > percentages[1]) return `<span style="color: green;">↑ ${percentage}%</span>`;
			else if (percentage < percentages[1]) return `<span style="color: red;">↓ ${percentage}%</span>`;
		}
		return `${percentage}%`;
	});
	return [habit.title, ...percentageText]
})

dv.table(
	["Habit", ...timeScaleTitles],
	habitRows
)
```

Here's what my table looks like today:
