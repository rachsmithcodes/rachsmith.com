### Apps: [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

I've been using Obsidian [for a while now](/loving-right-now-obsidian-md) as my note-taking app, but I've been writing more notes since I introduced Reader to my workflow. Reader lets me highlight the articles from the RSS feeds I subscribe to and add them to my Readwise account, and those highlights sync to my Obsidian vault. Then I have the highlights and links to the original article to reference when I'm coming up with my notes. I'm retaining more information from the posts and articles I read, rather than just thinking "wow, cool" and then forgetting it immediately.

### Pop-culture podcasts

I'm struggling to listen to any super-serious subject matter on podcasts at the moment, so I'm gravitating towards light-hearted pop culture podcasts at the moment: [Shameless](https://shamelessmediaco.com/shameless-podcast), [Bang On](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/bangon), [Mamamia Out Loud](https://www.mamamia.com.au/podcasts/mamamia-out-loud/) (all Australian).

### Exercise App: [Alomoves](https://www.alomoves.com/?utm_source=GoogleAdWords&utm_medium=Advertising&gclid=Cj0KCQjw1vSZBhDuARIsAKZlijSdQ5f_SqrhZndxYNmVWZ7FFaS_-1z_ad0FPNfD_s5g8M9zD3xPsm8aAiOIEALw_wcB)

I've been getting back on the yoga bandwagon. I haven't properly practiced it since before I had the kids but I'm quickly picking up where I left off. There are a lot of online yoga video subscriptions and apps out there, but in my opinion, Alo has the highest quality content. It's reasonably priced too, especially if you get it in a sale.

### My toddler learning new words every day

My youngest is going through a language explosion and is constantly learning new words. I love this stage of toddlerhood. His cute mispronunciations. The delight on his face when he realises he's communicated something reasonably complex, and I've actually understood it. The fact he finds certain words and phrases hilarious.
