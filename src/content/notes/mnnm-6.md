## Notable

**Daily lettering**. Inspired by last month's blogging challenge, I decided to take up another month-long "creativity sprint". I tried to dedicate some time to making a [handlettered piece on the iPad every day](/daily-lettering-1/). 

**I started rolling around with a pocket notebook**. The more [I do this](/field-notes/), the more I like it. The other day I hadn't done my morning setup in the notebook and I felt rather "untethered" all day, and I forgot to buy bananas ðŸ˜­. Absolutely sticking with this new system. 

**I kept buying stationary**. I feel like I could have an "obsession of the month" segment in these mn&n's because it seems like every month I'm locked in on something or other. This month it was pens (and notebooks - see above). 

**I listened to The Sanderlanche Podcast**. I was looking for a podcast after I started reading [The Mistborn Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistborn). I'm really enjoying this one! It is a discussion between a host (who has read the books) and three people (who are reading the books). I love to listen to the episode for each section just after I've read the section. 

**I got cleared to run again**. After months of going to the physio and doing rehab I was told I can ease back in to running! Just sticking to walk-runs at the moment, but I'm glad to finally be back at it.

## Work

Finished my permissions work finally. Now working on upgrading our billing and payments system at [CodePen](https://codepen.io).

**The work soundtrack:** [brat](https://open.spotify.com/album/2lIZef4lzdvZkiiCzvPKj7?si=OzR3MD99T0yfixpZaFocwQ)

## Watched

More [Marvelous Mrs Maisel](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5788792/). Finished Season 2 and now we'll take a break and watch something else for a bit.

## Read

I'm at the end of [Mistborn: The Well of Ascension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistborn:_The_Well_of_Ascension). No idea how Sanderson is going to wrap all this up by the end of the book.
