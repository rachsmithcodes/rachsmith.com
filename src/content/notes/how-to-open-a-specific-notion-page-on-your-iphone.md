excerpt: Notion's performance isn't great. This trick can help speed things up.

There are many reasons I love Notion, and I plan to share my setup for weekly and monthly reviews on this blog in the future. One thing that has really been bugging me lately is how bad the performance has gotten. Maybe my location (Australia) exacerbates this, but Notion has been *so slow* lately.

I have a page in my Notion called “Cleaning” that is basically a table of all the cleaning tasks in my home and when I did them last (so I don’t have to wonder about how long it has been since I cleaned the blinds - time is a flat circle). When I’m cleaning, I want to quickly open the table and update it. Opening the Notion app and navigating to the page I want is more clunky than I would like. Especially as I try to limit as much resistance to cleaning as possible!

Thanks to [this blog post](https://kevinjalbert.com/using-ios-shortcuts-to-open-notion-pages/) I could create an iOS shortcut that opens the Cleaning page. Kevin explains with screenshots, but the basic gist of it is:
1. Copy the URL to the page you want to open.
2. Replace `https://` with `notion://` in the URL
3. Create a new shortcut with the ‘Open URL’ (Safari) action

Once you’ve created the shortcut, you could add an icon for it to your home screen but I tend to just start typing the shortcut name in to search to launch it. This is much quicker than opening the Notion app, waiting for it to load and then navigating to the Cleaning page.
