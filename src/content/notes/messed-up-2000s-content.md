Is it any wonder, that despite all of the personal work I've done, and the feminist, body-positive and fat-acceptance material I've read, watched and learned about in my 30s - there still has not been one day in the last 20 years that I didn't wish I was just a bit smaller? How does any millennial woman feel okay about themselves after spending their brain-forming teen years in the late 90s/early 2000s? They really did a number on us.
