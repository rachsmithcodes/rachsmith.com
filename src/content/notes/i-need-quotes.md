This is day and post 24 of the #WeblogPoMo2024 challenge. I think I'm going to make it to the end of the month with a note for every day![^1]

This breeds confidence for a new [creativity sprint](/creativity-sprints/)/challenge for next month. I will be hand lettering one word or phrase every day for the month. Maybe on physical paper some days but mostly on the iPad Pro. 

So, I need some quotes and phrases to letter! Do you have any favourite quotes? They could be from historical figures, literature, fictional characters, religious texts... anything. Feel free to leave a comment or email/mention me with your suggestions! 

[^1]: Especially if I do "posts" like this where I'm just asking for stuff ðŸ˜†.
