My sister lent me this one. It's not the sort of thing I would normally choose to read because I like plotty fiction. This was sort of like 12 shorter stories, each from a different person's perspective. 

At first I was distracted by the lack of punctuation and typical sentence structure. I got used to it though after a chapter or two and then grew to like Evaristo's writing style. 

Even though you're only "with" each character for a chapter, I still emotionally connected with many of them. 

I found the book interesting - it kept me thinking about it in between reading sessions - but not so much enjoyable. The subject matter crosses rape/assault, parents dying young, miscarriage and extreme PPD, abusive partners, and shitty husbands. For this reason it was a heavy read.
