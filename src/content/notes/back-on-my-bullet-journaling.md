I got really into bullet journaling in 2016, along with everyone else. What got me hooked was the [beautiful spreads](https://www.pinterest.com.au/emmastudiess/bullet-journal-spreads/) people shared on Pinterest and Instagram. I like lettering and neat layouts, and I will take any excuse to buy new highlighters. 

I bujo'd pretty consistently until 2018, when my first baby was born, and that activity died. I had a non-sleeper on my hands, who had to be held for every nap. When you have a "high needs" stage-5 clinger baby (if you know, you know), you are so time-poor that spending 20 minutes colouring in your notebook is unfathomable. 

I also went through a transition with my relationship to productivity. Pre-baby, my bullet journal was a place where I could make these long to-do lists and then check them all off. Every check would tally up to a score of how happy I was with myself that day. When your self-worth is tied up in how much you *get done*, and you fail to get things done (due to looking after a baby), it doesn't leave you in a good place.

I've come a long way since then with (mostly) untangling my worth from my productivity (thanks, [matrescence](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/well/family/the-birth-of-a-mother.html)!). I'd also refined my productivity system down to a collection of digital tools that could accompany me throughout my hectic days with a small child and baby:
- notes barked into my Apple Watch via [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/). 
- Reminders via [Due](https://www.dueapp.com/) and task lists via [Todoist](https://todoist.com). 
- Events in [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical).

I now have a school-age kid and a toddler on my hands. There is a little more space in my days, especially in the mornings, as both children sleep past 5 am! I've picked up my dot-grid notebook again.

I'm figuring out what a hybrid digital/analog system looks like for me. I'm still doing my longer-term planning and weekly reviews in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). But I've moved the rapid logging from my Obsidian daily notes to my bullet journal. If you're interested, I can share it here when I've landed on a fit.

There is something to writing things down with pen and paper versus using an app for tasks. For some reason, I am much more likely to remember and complete a task I wrote than one I read from the "Today" view in a task manager or typed out into a text doc. I feel like I am approaching the day with more intention after setting up my bujo daily log in the morning.

> Your notebook greets you each morning with the pure, blank slate of an empty page. It serves as a small reminder that the day is as yet unwritten. It will become what you make of it.
