I am now two months in to my attempt to [journal every day](/my-goal-for-2024/), and I am pleased to report I have *something* on each daily page in my Hobonichi so far.  
## Notable

**I've been really focusing on home and family related stuff this month**. One of my kids had a birthday, and we have a massive USA trip looming at the end of March, so I've been list-making, planning and prepping.

**I went through a period of fixation on home organisation and cleaning.** This happens about once a year. I cleared out a few cupboards, sold some stuff on Marketplace (or gave it away), and improved some processes in the kitchen. I researched some [different](https://cleanmama.com/start-here/) [cleaning](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/cleaning/a31915249/fly-lady-cleaning-schedule/) [methods](https://www.theorganisedmum.blog/), but concluded they all involve spending too much time on cleaning. So I just waited for the fixation to pass and now I don't care about the state of the house again ðŸ˜Š.

A side-effect of all this focus on home life is that I've **published shit-all on this site**. Oh well.

[Last month](/mnnm-1/), I went hard on working out and running, and finished with a hamstring injury. I went to the physio and she told me (in a much nicer way) that **I had absolutely no business running those distances on my weak-ass glutes** (weak-ass ass?). So I've been doing the rehab exercises. It's like **every day is leg day** with the same boring routine, but I am seeing an improvement and should be back to running soon.

**I made a real effort to read more and scroll less**, after noting my abysmal reading count in last month's numbers. I ended up finishing three books. I plan to post a little review of the books I read this year, I just need to finish adding a custom note type for book reviews. 

## Work

We are so close to showing people what we've been calling "CodePen 2.0" internally. It's still early days but like no one outside of the team has seen my work for a long, long time. So that's exciting.

**The work soundtrack:** [It's the D.O double G](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6VprUnfeLcL4gsg57DHTyj?si=df64cefebb4645c4)

## Watched

[Five Bedrooms](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9755726/). Finished Season 3 and then took a break because I'd lost interest. Cheating storylines are boring.

[Fargo Season 5](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2802850/). I'm a Juno Temple fan. All the acting in this season was really good. Loved the finale episode. Glad I came back to this series after being underwhelmed with Season 3 and skipping Season 4.
