![The cover of The Organised Mum Method](/images/the-organised-mum.jpg)

I go through short-lived periods where I become fixated on one idea, and spend all my free time reading and/or watching videos about it.

Recently I was convinced that I need to get serious about cleaning the house properly. I got this book while obsessing over the finding the perfect routine to turn me in to a domestic goddess.

The routine is efficient compared to others, but it still requires dedicating 30 minutes every weekday to cleaning, on top of all the shit you already have to do (dishes, laundry, cleaning up the mess created by kids). That is 2.5 hours a week I do not wish to spend on just cleaning the house. 

The cleaning routine itself is a small part of the book, and then there are other general home-life organising tips that I already do and just seem obvious. Things like meal planning, online grocery shopping and batching tasks. I guess I'm an organised mum[^1]?
