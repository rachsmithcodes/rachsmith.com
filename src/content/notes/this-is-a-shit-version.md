I had someone recommend I check out the [Rich Roll podcast](https://www.richroll.com/all-episodes/), so I listened to a couple of recent episodes, including the one with [Steven Pressfield](https://www.google.com/search?q=steven+pressfield&oq=steven+pressfield&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

I must confess I still need to read [The War of Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_Art_(book)). It is on my Non-Fiction to-read list.

I liked this recommendation from Steven about how to get started writing something when you're feeling "stuck":

**Start whatever you're writing with *"this is what a bad version of this idea looks like:"*, or something similar to free yourself from thinking that whatever you write needs to be good.**

I loved this idea because usually, the thing that prevents me from writing anything is the feeling that I have to do it right. I'm going to add this strategy to [my writing toolbox](/how-i-wrote-more/).
