Recently I wrote about getting comfortable with [writing and publishing more frequently on this website](/2022-was-the-year-i-published/). A few people have expressed that they would like to do the same, so I thought I would share some specific things I did to make writing happen for me this year.

### I dropped the baggage around "blog post"
<blockquote>I wonder if the term “blog” has too much baggage. Too much history for it to really catch on again and make a dent. -- <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2022/12/26/bring-back-blogging/">Chris Coyier</a></blockquote>

For whatever reason, I struggled with writing "blog posts". I felt like blog posts had to be complete, good, pieces of writing with structural elements like introductions and conclusions and/or a comprehensive narrative. Then I discovered the concept of digital gardening via [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden/). I started thinking about my notes as works in progress, [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) rather than complete pieces of work. The mental shift helped me quit overthinking about what I published.

### I turned writing into a habit
I have a number of positive habits I try and do every day. Writing for 20 minutes is one of them. I don't get to it every day, but most days I force myself to sit and write, write literally anything, in my personal notes. 

### I wrote notes for myself first
If I sit down and write in the mindset of "this is a post for other people to consume", I start overthinking and overediting. So now I write just for myself. Almost all of the notes published here in the last 6 months started as a private note in my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault. When I think I've written a note that might be of interest to a public audience, I edit it and add links and context for public consumption, and then I publish.

### I practiced writing first and editing second
My natural inclination is to write a sentence 7 times in my head before I even start typing. Then re-write another 4 times in the document before I move on. This makes writing anything painstakingly slow. So I've been making a deliberate practice of just writing as many paragraphs as I can without stopping to analyze sentence structure. Then I circle back and edit at the end. This process is much faster! I'm still working on writing like this but I think I have come a long way from where I was.

### I reduced the friction around publishing
I've set up [some automation](/automating-obsidian-to-astro/) so I can "sync" a private Obsidian vault note with the markdown files in my [Astro](https://astro.build) website. Now it takes very little time or effort to have something in my personal digital garden show up on my public one at [rachsmith.com](https://rachsmith.com).
