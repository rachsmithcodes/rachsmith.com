There's a threshold of phone use that once crossed makes me feel pretty bad.

I don't think it has anything to do with the content I'm consuming. I don't really read News. I don't "doom scroll". The content I'm consuming through my phone usually falls somewhere between highly amusing and benign. I don't struggle with comparing my own life to others' highlight reels. 

I think it just boils down to the fact that there's nothing in the phone that truly matters to me. My core values are my relationships with my family, my mental health and wellbeing, and creativity/generativity.

Every hour spent with the phone is an hour not spent on anything I actually care about. Which is fine in small doses but as soon as it gets too much I know deep down that I'm not operating in alignment with my values, and that makes me feel quite bad about myself.
