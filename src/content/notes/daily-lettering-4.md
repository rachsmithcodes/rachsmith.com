excerpt: The final week of daily lettering.

I was starting to get over the lettering practice by this week, as I had run out of ideas and felt like it was getting repetitive. I definitely feel like having to "finish" something every day is preventing my ability to focus on quality and perhaps improve my skill. So for July's challenge I'm going to dedicate 20 minutes a day to creative practice and post the WIP on Mastodon.

I ended up with 27 pieces from the 30 days. I missed one day due to having 0 spoons and the last two because we were visiting some dear friends and I was too busy socialising. Even though it wasn't a perfect month I'm happy with the effort I made.
