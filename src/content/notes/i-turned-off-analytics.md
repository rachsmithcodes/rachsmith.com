I turned off the Plausible analytics for this site. I used to use analytics mostly to look for links back to my site from other creators. When I had so little traffic, I could traipse through the data and find the people who had found me. 

Something's changed with my traffic over the last few months. Maybe I hit some sort of "regular posting" threshold for the algorithm to deem me worthy, but some pages have started ranking with Google, and so now the majority of my traffic comes from search.

It's made the analytics data boring, to be honest. I don't care about what gets ranked on Google, I'm not trying to optimise for the people who come from that channel.

I keep writing on this site because it is the best way to find people who have similar interests as me. In particular - the nerds, because my IRL social relationships are with people who are very much on the normy side of the normy-to-nerdy spectrum.

People who arrive via search are just looking to get a question answered and move on. That's great and I hope I can help them, but they are not the reason I'm here. This site is here for the people who stay a while, have a look around and then send me an email to start an interesting conversation. 

So, I'm turning analytics off. If you are a new reader and you do decide to introduce yourself, maybe you could tell me who sent you. We'll leave it at that.

Thanks to Keenan for writing [this post](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/im-turning-off-my-website-analytics-because-im-very-brave-and-i-promise-i-truly-do-not-care-about-the-numbers) and inspiring me to finally give them up after considering it for a few months.
