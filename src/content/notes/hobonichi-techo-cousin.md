I've been rocking a bullet journal in Rhodia and Leuchtturm notebooks for many years. After seeing the [Hobonichi Techo Cousin](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2024/pc/detail_cover/cb24_jan_en/) on YouTube and Instagram I decided to give a dated planner a try in 2024. I'm pretty excited, I haven't used a dated planner since I was in high school!

Because my [goal for 2024](/my-goal-for-2024/) is to keep a reflective journaling habit, that will be the main purpose of the book. I've looked through all the spreads and come up with a plan on how I intend to use them all. 
<br/>

<p>I feel like this vertical monthly spread is begging to be a habit tracker, so I'll write my habits along the top and check them off down the days of the month. </p>

<br/>

<p>I am thinking I will use this spread as an "index" for the daily pages. So you can get the whole month at a glance and see the stand-out things that I journaled about.</p>

<br/>

<img src="/images/hobonichi-weekly.jpg" alt="the vertical weekly layout"  />
<p>I'm going to use this vertical weekly layout as a basic time tracker. Just mark down what I did when I did it.</p>

<br/>

<img src="/images/hobonichi-daily.jpg" alt="the daily page"  />
<p>Finally, the daily pages is where I will do all the things I used to do in my bullet journal, like rolling monthly, weekly, and daily todo lists, but also make sure to include a journal entry at the end of each day. </>

To get this planner to Australia from Japan was crazy expensive!! But I'm hoping it will be a worthwhile yearly purchase much like our [wall calendar](/a-big-ass-calendar/). The book itself is lovely. The paper is super thin and smooth and partially see-through, kind of like the paper in a bible. A very different vibe to my Rhodia books paper, but I like it. 

I plan to give an update after a few months with the Cousin.
