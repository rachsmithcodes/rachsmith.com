My toddler's favourite song is [I can be anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7-AF3l1E6U) from the Teletubbies Ready, Steady, Go! album[^1]. 

We were listening to the song when I asked the boys what they would be, if they could be anything.

*"A superhero!"*

*"A professional soccer player! What would you be mum?"*

I thought for a long while, and as I heard the answer finally come out of my mouth I knew it was the truth.

"I would be exactly what I am, doing the job I do now, and being your mum, of course!".

Was it due to my complete lack of imagination as an adult[^2]? Or a confirmation that I'm very happy with how my life has turned out? I'm going to conclude it's the latter.

What about you?


[^1]: I highly recommend this album by the way. Unlike the weird tuba music of old-school Teletubbies, it is filled with well written, highly produced pop bangers.
[^2]: My oldest was seriously unimpressed that I would choose to be a *software engineer*, when firefighter is an option.
