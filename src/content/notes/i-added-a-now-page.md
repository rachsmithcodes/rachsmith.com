I didn't post anything on this site for half of March and all of April. I also wasn't on socials much. It was such a long quiet period that a couple of people reached out to me via email to check that I was okay. It was incredibly touching and sweet, what with the absolute barriage of content we all receive every day, that anyone would notice that I hadn't posted and take the time to check in.

Anyway, I was thinking about how I could still keep a current "status update" on the site, even during times I'm not writing so much. I thought about weeknotes, but that seemed like too much work/pressure. I landed on a "now page". 

The now page, popularised by [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about), is a page where you can put what you're thinking about/doing/focused on now. I'm committing to updating mine once a week, even if only to confirm everything's the same as last week.

I've added the page but haven't found a spot for it in the site navigation. The small screen/mobile version doesn't have any more room for links[^1]. Perhaps I can put it in the footer with my contact details?

Until then, <a href="/now/">here's what I'm up to now</a>.

This has been post no. 6 for `#WeblogPoMo2024` and it is what I was interested in today.
