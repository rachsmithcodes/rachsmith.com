excerpt: These passive income ideas sound a lot like a second job

Who doesn't love the sound of passive income? Sitting back and doing nothing while letting the money roll in? As someone who's mostly relied on "active" income[^1] that sounded like a great idea. I thought I would see what I needed to do to make this passive income happen.

Most of the passive income suggestions I found online are along the lines of creating some kind of content product like an online course, e-book, YouTube videos etc. ðŸ¤”.

The reason they call it passive income is because it supposedly happens with ["minimal labour to earn or maintain"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_income).

Say I were to choose to create a course and try to use it as a source of passive income. I would have to:

- come up with the course content
- film the course
- build an audience who would actually pay for my course
- continue to promote the course so I can get ongoing signups
- provide support via questions and refund requests

That doesn't sound like "minimal labour" to me. It actually sounds like a lot of work. Work I would enjoy doing way less than my current developer day-job.

I'm calling bullshit on most of these passive income suggestions. Call it a side hustle or change of career to content creation... but it still involves a lot of effort. And you won't be able to sell it to me as a good idea when I make so much money from a very well paid "active income" job that I love.

[^1]: I do earn some passive income via dividends on shares via the [ETFs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asps) I buy each month. Now _that's_ what I call passive ðŸ˜´.
