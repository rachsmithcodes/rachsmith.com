Another week of lettering pieces. 

One thing I've noticed is that the need to publish something every day means they often feel quite rushed and I find myself wishing I could spend a little more time on them, and do a better job. The pressure is more positive than negative, because it is helping me get past my tendency towards perfectionism. But I think for next month's challenge (whatever that is, I haven't decided yet) I will set the parameters at 20 minutes of creative work a day, without having to finish something, and I'll just publish the WIP. Austin Kleon [would approve](/thoughts-on-show-your-work-by-austin-kleon/).
