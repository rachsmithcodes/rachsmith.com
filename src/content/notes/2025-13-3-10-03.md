Every now and then Spotify will throw a song in a generated playlist for a band I've never heard of before. Sometimes I'll look them up and discover that they're quite new, or they are really really new. Like one song new. No wikipedia entry new. 2000 Instagram followers new. It's a bit thrilling, to think that if they blow up, I can say I was a fan from the beginning, for real.

Anyway, this song slaps. Can't wait for more!
