excerpt: Notable things and stats from March 2024

The end of March came around while we were on our big US trip. Then I was really sick and things were hectic coming back and blah blah blah somehow we're at the end of April. So this update is a month late.

## Notable

**We went to Disneyland!!** Most  of the month was spent preparing for a 2 week holiday in the USA. We survived the 13 hour overnight flight. It turns out our youngest fella is a dream traveller. All the work and cost of the trip was worth it just for the Disney part. The boys had the time of their life and the oldest one will have memories to last a lifetime. 

**I sold our double stroller.** Some people get a bit emotional about no longer needing the baby stuff, but I toss it from the house with glee!

**I did a little bit of code sketching**. I made [this Pen](https://codepen.io/rachsmith/pen/BaEjGXV) and [this Pen](https://codepen.io/rachsmith/pen/YzMwMPx). That was fun, hoping to make some more soon.

**I kept going with the daily journaling**, even in to the trip. I think it is an established habit now. This is the reason I can even make a note about what happened in March. The experiment is [working as intended!](/my-goal-for-2024/)

## Work

I was working on the Permissions implementation for our new CodePen Editor - the stuff that unlocks collaboration as well as some advanced privacy settings.

**The work soundtrack:** [This is Simply Red](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO0FX6lq?si=17afb09022494d7c)

## Played

I didn't watch any notable movies/TV this month as I was more feeling the Switch games. [Kirby and The Forgotten Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby_and_the_Forgotten_Land) in particular.
