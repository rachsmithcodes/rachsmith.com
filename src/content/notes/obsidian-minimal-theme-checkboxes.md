I've been using the fantastic [Minimal theme](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal) for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for months but I only recently discovered that it supports checkbox icons.

You can find the syntax on the [documentation page for Minimal](https://minimal.guide/Block+types/Checklists). It includes [Bullet Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_journal) style notation! I'm going to add these to my [Raycast snippets](https://www.raycast.com/) because I won't be able to remember the letters.
