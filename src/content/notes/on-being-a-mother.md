On this Mother's Day, I would like to say that I am so very grateful to be a mother. I of course cherish my children and all the joy they bring: the funny things they say, the hugs and kisses and declarations of adoration, the fascinating experience of watching them grow and change. 

I think what I am most grateful for is the ways they have changed me. Mothering them has forced me to completely break down my identity and rebuild it from scratch. I have learned so much about myself and the world around me through their teaching. They have shown me that I control so little of this experience, but I am capable of far, far more than I could have imagined before I had them. 

I am 100% a better person now, because of them.
