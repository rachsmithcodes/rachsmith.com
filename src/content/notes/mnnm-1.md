This is a new series which is very much inspired by Dave Rupert's [Vibe Checks](https://daverupert.com/tag/vibecheck). I've long wanted to do something like that myself, but I had the problem of [not being able to remember](/my-goal-for-2024/)  the month that just happened. So I set the goal of daily journaling, and I am pleased to report that I stuck to it all month, and I now have things to share!

## Highlights

**I absolutely smashed it in the fitness department this month**. It was definitely giving "January". I wasn't sick once all month - truly a miracle when a family member attends daycare - and so my workout schedule went uninterrupted. Unfortunately I overdid the running and I now have tendonitis in my hamstring. 

**We are loving the addition of [the piano](/roland-f701/).** My husband and I are doing a bit of practice every day, and my oldest is truly obsessed. He practices for over an hour after school.

**Speaking of school, we're back**. The Australian school year starts in January, so we're in a new grade. There are lots of emotions and disregulation with any big transition, but things are starting to settle.

**We did a house swap with some friends in another town,** about 2.5 hours away. They have a tennis court and a huge yard. We have the beach down the road. Both families enjoyed the novelty of staying in another location, and it didn't cost us anything! It was a great idea from Andy, and I'd recommend people try it!

## Work

I'm in a spot where I can't share too much about work, because everything I'm working on hasn't been released yet. This month was mostly bug fixing in preparation for an Alpha release of the product I've been working on for literal *years*.

## Watched

[Mean Girls](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11762114/) at the cinema - I enjoyed it, but don't think I'll be rewatching. The original is one of my favourite movies of all time so it is hard to compete with that.

[The Dropout](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10166622/). The story of Elizabeth Holmes infuriates me, so it took me a while to get around to starting this. I enjoyed the first half when the only people who suffered were investors getting tricked out of money. The second half, when things get properly dark, bummed me out. I would recommend it though, just for the killer performance of Amanda Seyfried.

[Five Bedrooms](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9755726/). We were looking for something light after the dropout. I'm biased, but I just feel that nobody can do perfect soapy dramas quite like Australians. This is another fantastic example.
