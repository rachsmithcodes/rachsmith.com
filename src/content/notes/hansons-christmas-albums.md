On Christmas day, 1997 I was delighted to receive a CD from my parents: Hanson's "Snowed In". I've played it (the album, not the CD lol) every Christmas since. It is my go-to Christmas morning soundtrack. Of course, there is sentimental value in the album for me but it is genuinely a very good Christmas pop record!

Many would know Hanson as those kids who had a huge hit "MMMBop" in 1997. Their subsequent albums never achieved the commercial success of "Middle Of Nowhere" but have been writing, recording and touring ever since. 20 years after their first Christmas album, they released a second: "Finally It's Christmas". It's possibly better than the first. If you like pop artist Christmas albums, check them out.
