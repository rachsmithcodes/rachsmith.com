I love a good comedy series. It's my comfort television. These are my favourites over the years.

## 90s
We only had free-to-air TV at our house, so it was slim pickings from the four channels available to us. I was always happy to watch a re-run of these shows though.

[The Simpsons](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/)<br>
[The Nanny](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106080/)<br>
[Keeping Up Appearances](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098837/)<br>
[Fawlty Towers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072500/) (my dad owned the VHS tapes)

## 2000s
I was watching more Reality TV and crime shows in this decade, but there were a few DVD box-sets that my housemates and I would watch over and over.

[Seinfeld](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098904/)<br>
[Kath & Kim](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272397/)<br>
[The Mighty Boosh](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416394/)<br>

## 2010s
We got streaming platforms! And access to shows that had only been on cable previously.

[The Office (US)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/)<br>
[Parks and Recreation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1266020/)<br>
[Peep Show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387764/)<br>
[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472954/)

## 2020s
I haven't had a series reach "watch several times" status. I did enjoy [Schitt's Creek](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3526078/), but I've only watched it once. I think its due for a rewatch soon.
