![The cover of Madly, Deeply](/images/madly-deeply.jpg)

I bought this last year, thinking it would be some inspo for my personal challenge to [keep a daily journal all year](/my-goal-for-2024/). 

I'm an Alan Rickman stan. I've never, ever been so upset about a celebrity dying as I was the day Alan Rickman died. When I first heard about this book I worried about the ethics of publishing someone's personal diaries, but when I learned his wife was behind the decision I decided to trust that he would be okay with it too.

It's clear that anything too personal or spicy has been edited out (I was glad to see this). What is left is actually a fairly dry, boring read. This was actually perfect for my purposes. If Alan's notes on Hollywood Parties and working on the Harry freaking Potter movies still read as boring... well that takes the pressure off me and my diary.

The main impression I got from the diaries was that Alan really, really cared about his work and wanted to do an exceptional job, no matter the gig. I can relate.
