After discovering the idea of a [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden), [I declared this website is no longer a blog](/my-blog-is-dead/). I've still had trouble with changing my mindset around the individual notes on this site, and not treating every note with the gravity of a "finished", polished blog post. 

I am hugely inspired by [Andy Matuschak's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) and [Mike Crittenden's short, daily posts](https://critter.blog/2021/02/10/blogging-as-a-zettelkasten/). I want to make my website a similar space where I can add short, in progress thoughts as well as more considered notes that read more like a classic blog post. 

One of the things that is getting in my way is worrying about the organization of the notes. Many potential future notes don't fall under one of my main tag types. I don't want to add a tonne of tags to the site but I also don't want to end up with 100s of notes under [miscellany](https://rachsmith.com/tag/miscellany/). I think for now, I will publish shorter notes without a tag and figure out how to best enable people to get to them after I have written so many that it becomes a problem worth worrying about.
