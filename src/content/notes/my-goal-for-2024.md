We are closing in on the end of December, the time of year when people put some great "year in review" type posts on their blogs. I am always impressed by people's ability to recount the various achievements and happenings of the year, especially those who can go into detail. This is because I would struggle to recount what happened last week, let alone in March.

I spend life oscillating between two modes - the energiser bunny and the sloth. Lately, I've been putting a lot of effort into [smoothing out the peaks](/today-was-an-amazing-regular-day/), and I've had success at making the swings less extreme, but the pattern remains. I think it might just be how I operate. 

Whether I'm in the mode where I'm pushing forward, smashing all the goals and getting things done, or the other where I am apathetic about most things and just want to rot on TikTok, I fail to reflect on the happenings of the day. I'm either going so fast I don't want to slow down and reflect, or... I could not be bothered. 

The result appears to be an inability to recount my own life. It's not like I can't remember individual moments. I have thousands of memories, especially of my boys: the times I made them shriek with laughter, the next-level meltdowns,  how they smelled after daycare, school, a bath. But as for being able to remember what we did as a family when or what happened to me personally or professionally throughout 2023, I couldn't tell you.

This bothers me, so my goal for 2024 is to change it. The tool for doing so will be my journal. I'm pretty good at keeping a journaling habit, but I tend to stick to planning. I make to-do lists, goals, and plans. I'm pretty bad at doing a "diary" entry at the end of the day. So, the "keystone habit" I will use to achieve this goal for next year will be to include a reflection entry, even if it is as simple as listing what happened without much context.

The plan is to do a daily review, which I can refer to in a weekly review, which I can refer to in a monthly review, which I can refer to in a yearly review.

If all goes to plan, I will be able to do one of those cool yearly review posts on this site a year from now ü§ûüèº.
