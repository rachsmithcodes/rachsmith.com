excerpt: My Hobonichi Planners for 2025

Last I had a [Hobonichi Techo Cousin](/hobonichi-techo-cousin/) and I loved so many things about it: the paper, the layout, how flat it lays on the desk. The one thing that bothered me was just how big the pages were. I struggled to fill them and it just felt like a waste having so many half-blank pages. 

So this year I'm going to do my daily journaling in the A6 size. I bought a HON because I loved the rainbow cover. It is sooo cute and small compared to my Cousin. Can't wait to crack it open today.

I struggled to fill the daily pages in the Cousin, but then on Sundays I would sometimes run out of space. This is because I would write a little "week review" that summed up the daily entries, as well as the day entry. So I bought a Hobonichi Weeks. I will put all my week reviews in there, in the one location. I think this will make it easier to look back on the month when I do my [mn&n's](https://rachsmith.com/tags/#mn&n).

I am still using a little [Field Notes](/field-notes/) as my daily driver. Still loving this system. It's got to a point where I feel quite lost/scattered if I haven't checked in with the notebook and set up for the day.
