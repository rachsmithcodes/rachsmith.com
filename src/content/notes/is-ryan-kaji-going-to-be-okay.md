Iâ€™ve never watched one of _those_ [family vlogger YouTube channels](http://culture.affinitymagazine.us/family-vloggers-are-exploitative-and-must-be-stopped/amp/) because they creep me out. Parents exploiting their kids for views is so messed up, I wonâ€™t support it.

However, my kid really loves watching [Ryanâ€™s world](https://youtube.com/c/RyanToysReview). So weâ€™ve watched a lot of Ryan in our house. Thereâ€™s a reason heâ€™s been one of YouTubeâ€™s top earners. Heâ€™s great on camera and his parents are content geniuses. He appears to be having a good time.

The tricky thing about fame for kids is they canâ€™t actually consent to being famous, because they canâ€™t fully understand what happens when you are a famous child. You are sexualised by sickos on the internet. People donâ€™t like thinking or talking about it, but itâ€™s just what happens.

I canâ€™t imagine what it would be like to think you are safe as a child, only to realise later on that whole time you were being lusted after by adults. I remember Mara Wilson writing about [how she had to come to terms with how she was sexualised as a child](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/23/opinion/britney-spears-mara-wilson-hollywood.html), getting letters from old men ðŸ¤®. I just know I could never put my kids through that, even if the pay-check is millions.

Recently I watched the Harry Potter 20th anniversary special, and I was really struck by how all the former child stars reflected on having to work so hard, and being so famous. They all concluded that they were grateful and wouldnâ€™t change their experience. It was a real contrast to the typical [Nickelodeon/Disney child star trauma](https://youtu.be/cXOATB1v3jM) story. It would appear that it is possible to be a child in entertainment and end up okay.

Maybe Ryan will be like one of those Harry Potter kids. Or maybe I just tell myself that to justify watching the videos. I guess weâ€™ll have to wait to find out.
