This made me laugh, multiple times, because of the dunks on "big brained" developers.

I am a naturally-inclined "big brained" developer. Not to blow smoke up my own arse, but I've always tended to pick up logical concepts fast. School was a breeze for me for that reason. I can read and understand other people's complex code, and get my head around systems faster than the average bloke.

The day I learnt about abstractions may have been the most exciting day of my developer journey. You know that [galaxy brain meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/galaxy-brain) where the brain gets more and more lit up? That's me, absolutely frothing on how clever I am coming up with my clever solution to the problem before me[^1]. You know that line in Jurassic Park where Jeff Goldblum talks about how the scientists **_"were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should?"_** That could be said about me, and my code, if I don't check myself.

Of course, I know the Grug brained developer is right. [Complexity is the eternal enemy](https://grugbrain.dev/#grug-on-complexity). And the desire to be clever is the enemy within myself, that I battle every day.

[^1]: It feels so fucking good to be so clever.
