I remember people's fervour for Matthew Walker's [Why We Sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_We_Sleep) in 2018 very well. I recall it so clearly because I was triggered by many of the claims in that book, as I was _not_ sleeping in 2018. I had a baby who did not sleep, and so I did not sleep.

So when [my favourite podcast](https://www.maintenancephase.com/) did [an episode](https://maintenancephase.buzzsprout.com/1411126/9716285-the-sleep-loss-epidemic) about the debunking of the book I felt relieved!

The podcast is largely based around [this post](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/) from Alexey Guzey who appears to be the first person who actually bothered to vet the claims in the book and their references? The whole ordeal is a real insight to just how dodgy some of these pop-science books on the best-seller lists are.

Don't get me wrong, I love sleep. And one day I hope to get back to my pre-child glory of a solid 8 hours a night. But at least now I don't have to worry about my decreased lifespan, on top of my kids' night waking.
