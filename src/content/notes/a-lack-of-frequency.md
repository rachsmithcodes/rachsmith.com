I have this story in my head, that the longer I go without writing a note here, the better that note has to be when I do eventually come back and post again. 

I was looking on the internet to see if this is a common thought pattern - that if something is infrequent, it must be excellent.

I couldn't find anything like that on the psych blogs, so I have to assume that I've taken the phrases "quality over quantity" or "quantity over quality" and turned that in to believing "quantity" and "quality" must be mutually exclusive.

You can [post infrequently, and have each of those posts be an absolute banger](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/the-imperfectionist), or you [can regularly put out stuff that's okay](https://seths.blog/). 

You can't post average shit every now and then.[^1]

[^1]: You can, of course. And so can I, as long as I ignore the voice in my head telling me I can't.
