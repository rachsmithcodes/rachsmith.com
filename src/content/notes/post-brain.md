I don't know if there's a proper name for this pattern of thinking, so I'll just call it Post Brain. 

Post Brain is when you go about your day constantly scanning for anything you can turn in to content, or what would make a great "post". 

I had a bad, bad case of Post Brain for a few years, when I was really in to Twitter. I couldn't experience anything, overhear anything, or have a conversation without a persistent algorithm running in the background of my brain: always assessing whether I could turn this in to a pithy or amusing observation that would fit in a Tweet.

At some point I was cured of Post Brain, I think having a baby may have finally finished it off. My days were totally consumed by my first child, and since I didn't want to invade his privacy by posting about him, I got out of the habit of assessing the world in terms of post content.

Looking back now, it all seems a little bit coo-coo bananas. So many thought-cycles spent on constructing hypothetical Tweets!! And for what?! I wonder else could I have done with the creativity and brain power of my early 20s if I didn't expend so much energy thinking about social media.

These days, I almost have the opposite of Post Brain. I am so bad at turning my experiences in to content, I will often reach 7pm on any particular day of this #WeblogPoMo2024 challenge and think "shit! What am I going to post about?" because I have come up with nothing throughout the day. Still, I think I'm much better off.
