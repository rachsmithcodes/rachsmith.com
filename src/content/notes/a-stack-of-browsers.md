I was a very happy [Arc](https://arc.net/) user for a couple of years, but after The Browser Company announced they would [no longer be working on it](https://browsercompany.substack.com/p/letter-to-arc-members-2025), I started to assess alternatives. 

Now I've ended up with a stack of browsers, instead of reaching for a single browser to do all the things. 

## [Polypane](https://polypane.app/)
For dev work involving designing, layout and styling. 

## [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_au/chrome/)
For all other dev work.

## [Horse](https://gethorse.com/)
For general internet usage. Horse is a niche one that I imagine is only appealing to a small subset of people, of which I just happen to be a part of. If you are [less typical](/less-typical/), always open links in a new tab, and have about 200 tabs open at a time "just in case" you want to go back to one... Horse might appeal to you.

Polypane and Horse both require subscriptions, but [I'm cool with that](/paying-for-software-subscriptions-is-my-passion/). Especially for indie apps.
