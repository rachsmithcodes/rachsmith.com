excerpt: "I thought I wasn't smart enough to be a programmer, but I just hadn't found the right languages yet."

When I was 17, I started a degree in Software Engineering. The first programming language I learnt was [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)), and I don't think we ever even programmed with it. I just learnt the syntax, and all the assessments were writing answers to logic problems on paper! 

Then there was another language. I think it might have been [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))? The assessments were all command-line based. You would write a little program, and then try to execute it. I remember spending hours trying to get the damn things to compile, but it just wasn't happening for me.

The only real web tech I came across in that course was [JSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Server_Pages) (it was 2005). Again, I remember spending so much time trying to get a login form working with JSP. I don't recall there being much error feedback either. It was like the thing worked or... blank page.

Needless to say, I didn't like the Software Engineering degree. I found it very difficult and found little joy in it. My takeaway at 19 was that I wasn't smart enough to be a programmer. I put my class credits towards a 3 year IT degree and enrolled in Business Management. 

I was struck by how different Business School assessments were. If I spent 20 hours on an essay, I had a decent quality essay worthy of a high grade. In my SE degree, I could spend 40 hours beating my head against the command line... and barely get a passing grade.

I went on a different path for a while, but my love for the web led me to consider pursuing a career in web design. I enrolled in an "Interactive Media" degree[^1]. One of my first classes was on HTML and CSS. 

When I would add HTML and CSS to a page, I would get instant feedback. I would add the code, and things would appear on the page. They may not have looked exactly right, but they were there, giving me clues as to whether I was on the right track. I was hooked.

I remember working on my assignments on the weekends and spending hours getting the HTML and CSS right, but it felt like no time at all. I would be so absorbed by it I would forget to eat. I wouldn't learn the name for it until years later, but I was experiencing intense [Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) for the first time in my life.

Soon after that, I started using [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript). I recognised the concepts I had been taught in my SE degree, like variables, objects, and arrays. They were no longer abstract ideas but valuable tools. I was building real UI and animations instead of completing abstract tasks like "sorting a tree". Everything fell into place in that context. I soon realised web design wasn't really for me. I was going to be a developer and an amazing one at that.

I'm sharing all this to say that if you want to learn how to code or be a developer of any kind, how important it is to find the technology and feedback loop that tickles your brain in just the right way. That allows you to create *something* that inspires you to keep learning and build your confidence. For me, in 2010, that was HTML and CSS, but for you, it might be [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) or something else entirely. 

After using JavaScript, I've gone on to learn many more programming languages and technologies across the stack. If I were handed those command-line assessments that left me feeling so inadequate and stupid in 2005, I could do them easily today. I just needed to find the right context in which I could learn programming. My wish is that everyone else who is struggling can do the same.
