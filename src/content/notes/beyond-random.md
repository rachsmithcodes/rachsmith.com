A great explanation with visuals of why random might not be the best tool for your generative creations.

When I was making lots of [animated Pens](https://codepen.io/rachsmith), my favourite way to animate was to use generative elements, and I leaned on `Math.random()` for almost all of it. This post makes me excited to use more normal distribution or noise when I get back to making art again.
