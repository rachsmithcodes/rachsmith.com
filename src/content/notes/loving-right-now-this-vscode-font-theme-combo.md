I am the person who will spend 3 hours trying out different themes and fonts in my Editor. After finally choosing a new one, I'll use it for an afternoon before deciding to switch back to the same setup I had before. I like what I like.

For the longest time, that was [gerane's rainbow Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gerane.Theme-rainbow&ssr=false) and [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/styles/operatormono). I think Operator Mono was the first coding font I saw using italics for comments. I immediately fell in love, dropped a cool 200 bucks on it and never looked back.

Recently I discovered that [Sarah Drasner](https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/) had made a new theme, called [In Bed By 7pm](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.inbedby7pm). I initially tried it out because a theme name has never so accurately reflected my lifestyle. Unlike trial runs with other themes in the past, I didn't want to switch back. This theme just has the perfect amount of purple and is very easy on the eyes. I love it.

In the screenshots for the theme, I couldn't help notice how cute the font was - [Dank Mono](https://gumroad.com/l/dank-mono). So now I'm just living my life with an all-Sarah-Drasner inspired setup.
