A resource that has helped me in my mothering journey is [Dr. Sophie Brock](https://drsophiebrock.com/). She is a Motherhood Studies Sociologist who has brought so much language to things that I could *feel* when I became a mother but couldn't explain.

From her website:
> Motherhood is different to mothering.
> Mothers _do_ their mothering within the _context_ of Motherhood.
> The _social rules_ around Motherhood are the ones Mothers live their lives within.
> These rules become embedded within our own lives, and in the systems, structures, and institutions that we live within.
> Understanding these rules is the first step to an empowered, liberated, reimagined version of Motherhood.

She has a fantastic podcast [The Good Enough Mother](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/the-good-enough-mother/id1480149306). I highly recommend to any mother or parenting partner who wants to understand the experience of motherhood better. 

After listening to her podcast, I realised that I had entered motherhood fully believing in the Perfect Mother Myth. The dissonance between that and reality of being a mother was part of what made the transition so difficult.

Her work helps me understand how I can truly enjoy being a Mother, while simultaneously feeling strangled by motherhood at times.
