I don't know if you've tried to use websites lately, but it's largely a mess out there.

It feels like things have descended in to a complete shitshow[^1]
and are only getting worse. I know for some comrades, fellow developers who love websites and care about making good websites, this is too heartbreaking to bear. They consider giving up this vocation, because striving so hard to make a difference and feeling like you are achieving nothing is literally the path to burnout.

I understand that perspective, but for me, I almost feel the opposite.

If the web is now a metaphorical barren wasteland, pillaged by commercial interests and [growth-at-all-costs management consultants](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-managers-are-breaking-the-internet/id1730587238?i=1000653410986), then I'm all the more motivated to keep my little patch of land lush, and green, and filled with rainbow flowers.

So, feel free to stop by any time and stay as long as you like. I won't track you, make you look at ads, ask you to download my app, harass you with popups, suggest you sign up for my newsletter or push you through a sales funnel. Enjoy the garden, and the peace üíê.

[^1]: This note may have been inspired in-part by the experience of using Microsoft/Minecraft's various "websites" to unlock a single permission for my kid's account. A horrendous hour of my life that I'll never get back.
