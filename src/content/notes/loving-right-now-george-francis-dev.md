A long time ago, creating generative code art was my favourite hobby. Then life happened: I moved countries, bought a house, adopted a dog and grew and birthed and raised two tiny humans. I felt like I didn't have the time or energy to make art.

Lately, I've been feeling the call to get back to it. I've been starting with searching for and reading tutorials to see what people are up to these days with JavaScript, CSS, SVG and WebGL. That's how I came across George Francis' blog at [georgefrancis.dev](https://georgefrancis.dev).

George makes seriously high quality, very easy to follow tutorial style posts. My favourites: [Crafting Organic Patterns With Voronoi Tessellations](https://georgefrancis.dev/writing/crafting-organic-patterns-with-voronoi-tessellations/) and [Build a Smooth, Animated Blob Using SVG + JavaScript](https://georgefrancis.dev/writing/build-a-smooth-animated-blob-with-svg-and-js/). He also has a whole bunch cool [Pens](https://codepen.io/georgedoescode) with a modern visual style.
