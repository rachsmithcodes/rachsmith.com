On a recent evening I was feeling very tired. It had been a big day and I was just... busted. What I should have done was get in to bed, read my book, and turn out the lights early. I instead went to my go-to salve for feeling worn out, a screen. Not just one screen, two screens.  I wanted to watch an easy show and play some games on my phone.

I went looking for some favourites on my phone - [Merge Mansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_Mansion) and [Royal Match](https://dreamgames.com/games/), and found they were deleted. Why? I could not recall. Anyway, I downloaded them again and played them, for too long. I stayed up past my usual bedtime because Royal Match had rewarded me with unlimited turns and bonus items for coming back.

I was a few days in to having the games on my phone when I remembered why I deleted them last time. These games interfere with my life. I have good phone boundaries when I'm with my kids, doing work, or working out, but I had spent every other bit of spare "me" time merging and matching. I wasn't going to bed on time. 

Thankfully I had a moment of self awareness on day three of the merging and matching madness, and deleted the apps again. I am writing this note now to help me remember that these apps are BANNED from my phone for a reason.

Some people can just casually play these games every now and then and be fine. Some people can't. I am in the latter camp.
