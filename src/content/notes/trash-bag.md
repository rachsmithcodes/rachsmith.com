Sometimes I've just gotta clear the house of extra stuff. When the energy hits I go through every area in the house and bin, give away or sell anything we're not using anymore.

I think that compared to the average household my propensity for accumulation things is lower than average, but my tolerance for cluttered spaces is also low, so the big black trash bag energy hits like once a year. 

Doing this is an exercise in cataloging every time I've become momentarily obsessed with a random idea and bought stuff for it. Like the point and shoot camera for taking pics of my kids from when I was giving up my phone. Or the brow products when I decided I was going to be that girl who does her brows every day. The adult colouring books. The press-on nails. The stationary... my God the stationary. 

This behaviour is the only thing that gets in the way of living the minimalist low-waste lifestyle I aspire to have. Next time I become fixated on a purchase for a great new idea I'll try to remember this post before I add to cart.
