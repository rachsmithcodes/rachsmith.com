excerpt: I've written a journal entry for every day this year. Here are some observations.

My main goal for this year was to [journal something about my day](/my-goal-for-2024/), every day. Some observations:

- I can't actually believe I've stuck to it this long. My usual M.O. is to declare I am going to do something like this, and then lose interest after about 3 weeks. Some days I have to catch up for the day before, but I have an entry for every day. 
- I think the main reason I have stuck with it, is the *experiment is working!* I am able to "remember" more of my days/weeks months. Some days I don't enjoy the process, but I am truly enjoying the outcome.
- The time window for me being able to recall anything about my day is around 48 hours. After that, who knows what I did 3+ days ago.
- Perhaps it is because I can't reliably recall what actually happened, that my brain makes up entirely incorrect stories about the week or month. For example, I'll be walking around with the thought "I got nothing done this week", only to review my journal and discover I did in fact get a lot done. Similarly, I will think something happened "ages ago" when it was only 15 days ago. 
- This practice has "slowed time down". Rather than having the year fly past, suddenly arriving in November and wondering what the hell happened and how I got here, I feel like I'm "living" every day, every week and every month. The sensation of time slipping away is gone. It's been a long, full, wonderful year so far.
- I love my [Hobonichi Techo Cousin](/hobonichi-techo-cousin/). Will definitely be repurchasing for 2025, or perhaps the Avec version (the same book split in two).
