A couple of months ago the algorithm caught on to the fact I'd been [told I can't run](/mnnm-2/) on a hamstring injury. It started pushing rebounding content, suggesting it was a lower-impact alternative to running.

I bought a cheap rebounder and although I enjoyed the exercise, the sound it made (as a spring model) was driving me up the wall. There are certain sounds and textures I really struggle with, and I just *couldn't* with the sound the springs made. 

I did a fair bit of research around rebounders (available in Australia) that use bungee chords. I concluded that I would probably better off paying for one of the quality models than using a cheaper one that will break soon. 

And that's how I ended up dropping $500AUD (an obscene amount) on the cheapest JumpSport rebounder: the [JumpSport 220](https://www.jumpsport.com/jumpsport-200-series-fitness-trampolines-39/). After a month with it, I have zero regrets.

The difference between this tramp and the cheaper one was noticeable immediately. It was way bouncier and easier on the joints, and best of all, it is virtually silent.

In terms of available rebounding content, there's plenty on YouTube. Most content creators have free workouts on there and then some way to access a paid subscription. It all feels very home-video and low-production compared to the stuff I'm used to ([Apple Fitness](https://www.apple.com/au/apple-fitness-plus/), [Sweat](https://sweat.com/), [Alo Moves](https://www.alomoves.com/) etc), but it's still great stuff. 

My favourite creator is [Earth & Owl](https://www.youtube.com/@EarthOwl), which is actually an account for seniors, but this is where I'm at with my rebounding abilities: old lady level, lol. Balance doesn't come naturally to me, so doing even simple moves on there is hard work! 

Rebounding feels like it falls in to one of those niche exercise options that doesn't have mainstream popularity, but the people who do do it are borderline fanatical and make it part of their identity. Like rock climbing or the early days of CrossFit. 

At the risk of sounding like one of these people, I'm absolutely loving it, and would highly recommend if you're looking for an interesting way to move more.
