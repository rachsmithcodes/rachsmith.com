[Another](/brett-terpstras-searchlink/) piece of productivity gold from [this Automators podcast episode](https://www.relay.fm/automators/116): the concept of a hyper key.

A hyper key is when you remap a mostly unused key (such as the Caps Lock key) to be all the modifier keys (AKA Control, Shift, Command and Option) pressed at once. This is used to get around the issue in many apps where all the good keyboard shortcuts are taken and you're having to remember to hold down a series of 2 or more modifiers to do what you want ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) comes to mind). Instead, you can just use Caps Lock + a letter and your shortcut will probably be unique. 

There are ways to set up a hyper key [in Karabiner Elements](https://brettterpstra.com/2017/06/15/a-hyper-key-with-karabiner-elements-full-instructions/) or [Better Touch Tool](https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2021/02/hyper-key-via-bettertouchtool/) but I tried [this standalone Mac App called Hyperkey](https://hyperkey.app/) and it works just great.
