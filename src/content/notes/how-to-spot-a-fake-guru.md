A fake guru insists that as long as you follow their advice correctly, you will achieve all of the outcomes you could possibly want. If you attempt to follow their advice and it doesn't work, they insist the problem isn't with their advice but with the way you followed it. According to the fake guru, their methodology/system/program beliefs are always right. You are just doing it wrong.

This is the primary M.O. of cult leaders, fad diet creators and MLM CEOs, but they also show up in places you might not expect, like parenting and relationships experts.
