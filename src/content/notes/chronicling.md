I wouldn't really call it a goal for the year, because it is too vague, but I had set an *intention* for 2024 that I would spend more of my free time in creative practice - whether that be writing, lettering, drawing, creative coding or piano.

I figured I should probably keep track of when I followed through on my intention, and I was doing so in my [planner](/hobonichi-techo-cousin/), but I was looking for a digital format to store the data as well.

Enter [Chronicling](https://chroniclingapp.com/): iOS an app to track anything. I've been keeping track of all my creative practice, my exercise, when we go out to the park or the beach etc. and whenever I get stuck in a scrolling session/YouTube wormhole. 

I thought I'd share the app with you because it is really well designed, has a great watch app, and iPhone widgets. It is especially impressive as this is the first app from the developer, [Rebecca Owen](https://beccais.online/projects/).
