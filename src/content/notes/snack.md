This is my favourite snack to eat at the moment.

You need:
- frozen blueberries
- cottage cheese
- peanut butter

The amount of each doesn't matter. I probably go overboard on the blueberries because I love them.

1. Put cottage cheese in a bowl
2. Put a spoon of peanut butter on the cottage cheese
3. Tip the blueberries in to a pan and heat them until they are warm. You can squish them and cook the juice a bit until it resembles a chunky jam.
4. Dump the hot blueberries on the peanut butter

I have a nutrition goal at the moment to include protein, fibre and colour (via plants), and healthy fats in every snack/meal. This meets that requirement and tastes like a sweet & salty dessert. I'm obsessed!
