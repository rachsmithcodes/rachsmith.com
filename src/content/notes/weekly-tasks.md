I got back into [bullet journaling](/back-on-my-bullet-journaling/) this year. In the last few months, my productivity system has moved more and more from the digital back to the "analog"[^1].

I discovered this way of tracking tasks for the week recently, and it has worked well for me, so I thought I would share.

In my bullet journal, I list the things I need to get done in the month, the week and the day. I don't always know exactly when they can/will get done. I just know I would like to do them in that time frame.

The [Alastair Method](https://myntplanning.com/beginners-guide-alastair-method/) for bullet journaling is when you place some vertical columns next to your list of tasks. The columns could be anything you want to group/organise your tasks by. I choose days. So, I have Monday to Sunday as my columns next to the list. And then, if I plan to do the task on a specific day, I will add a dot to the column. If the task is done, I cross it off in the day I did it and the overall list.

I especially love how my exercise plan can be viewed with a glance at a few lines in the notebook. This is an excellent method for repeating tasks. 

I do many things every week that I don't track in my weekly list (meal planning, cooking, groceries, cleaning, etc.) because I just do them without planning them first. 

[^1]: For my personal life that is. Work planning and tracking is all done via software.
