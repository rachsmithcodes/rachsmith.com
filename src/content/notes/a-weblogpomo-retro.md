Today is the 30th, and tomorrow's post will be a notes & numbers for May, marking the end of the #WeblogPoMo2024 challenge. 

If you are a subscriber and are tired of having me pop up in your RSS reader constantly, I apologise, and it will be over soon. I don't intend to keep up the daily posting.

I joined the challenge on a whim, and I've only resented the decision for about 20% of the days. That's actually pretty good for [someone like me](https://gretchenrubin.com/quiz/the-four-tendencies-quiz/rebel/)! Overall, I'm really happy I did it and I want to thank [Annie](https://anniegreens.lol/) for coming up with the idea. 

Some things I loved about posting daily for a month:

- Because I was looking at the site every day, I was motivated to tinker with it, fix a few things and make improvements. 
- The challenge brought me some lovely new readers, who introduced themselves via email. I'm always happy to hear people have got something out of my notes here. 
- Lately I've been leaving writing for when the mood strikes. That doesn't work so well when life gets busy... the mood doesn't get a chance to strike. When you're forced to write *something*, something comes to the surface.
- On the days I couldn't think of what to write, I cheated a little by making a code sketch instead, and sharing that. I feel like I probably wouldn't have got to making these sketches if I didn't have the pressure of the challenge. 

Although I won't keep posting daily, I think there's something to committing to a set schedule. So for June I'll try to post twice a week.
