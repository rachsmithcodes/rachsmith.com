It was a busy, and kinda stressful month. I felt like I had a lot on my plate in terms of responsibilities, and a family member had a big health scare. I was glad to see the back of July in the end!

## Notable

**My drawing creativity sprint died in the arse**. I tried to get some drawing done every day, but I ended up with too much work to do for school, the family and day job. I hope to get back in to the flow of it soon. 

**I took my kid to the Roller Rink**.
When I was a kid one of my favourite things to do on school holidays was to go roller blading at the local roller skating rink. I took my oldest roller skating for the first time and he LOVED it. I was amazed (and stoked) to see how these school holiday sessions are basically the same 30 years later. They even played some music from the old days!

**One big day of drinking pretty much ruined half the month**. I'd actually spent the previous couple of months basically alcohol-free, but Andy and I went to an event with a drinks package and family/friends who love to get rowdy. I wasn't out of control but I would have had maybe 6/7 drinks over the course of the afternoon/night. I don't think its a coincidence that the 2 weeks that followed was the worst stretch in mood/mental health that I've had all year. Drinking is hard. I don't know how I did so much of it in my teens and 20s!!

**I spent my free evenings on the Switch**
That felt like all I could manage once the day was over. I mostly played [Super Mario Bros Wonder](https://supermariobroswonder.nintendo.com/). I just love how pretty that game is. 

## Work

Spent most of the month working on upgrading our billing and payments system at [CodePen](https://codepen.io).

**The work soundtrack:** [brat](https://open.spotify.com/album/2lIZef4lzdvZkiiCzvPKj7?si=OzR3MD99T0yfixpZaFocwQ) (again - I really like this album)

## Watched

[Colin from Accounts](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18228732/) Season 2. I was kind of meh on the storyline/drama between the main characters of this season, but it was really funny!

## Read

I finished the Mistborn original Trilogy. Had to take a break from the Sanderson books when it was over, because I was staying up too late to read them.

## The numbers
