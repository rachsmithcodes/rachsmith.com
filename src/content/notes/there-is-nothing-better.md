excerpt: A little mantra that helps me remember what's important.

*There is nothing better*.

Hanging out with my kids is enjoyable. The thing that makes me forget that is all the FOMO I get when I'm thinking about the work or other productive things I could be doing instead, or what content I could be consuming in my phone. 

When it comes to the crunch, my relationship with my partner and kids is more important to me than anything else. When I look within myself, past all the noise and distraction, I see that for me there really is nothing better than hanging out with my kids. So I use this phrase to remind myself of that while I'm playing my 300th game of hungry hippos.
