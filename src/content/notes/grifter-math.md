I am partial to watching a bit of productivity and self development material on YouTube. I think that's why all my ads are get-rich-quick grifters.

The thing I don't get is how I'm supposed to believe that [old mate](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/old_mate) who apparently makes $30K a day by buying crypto coins for an hour in the morning and selling them at the end of the day is then spending his time building a course teaching people to do the same thing, filming ads for YouTube and flogging it for a (short term offer) of $99 a piece.

Sir, according to your own numbers you are making 10 million a year from trading alone. People who actually make that much money aren't selling shitty courses on YouTube.
