excerpt: Spotify streaming quality has completely gone to pot. It does this
  thing where it skips (kind of like an old CD would) and then tries to make up

I've paid for Spotify for 12 years. I wonder why, in 2025 with 5G and an iPhone 14 Pro Max the streaming playback quality is the worst its ever been? Are they cheaping out on servers? Is the software just worse now?
