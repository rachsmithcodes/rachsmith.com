I’ve been rewriting one of my home-cooked [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction) apps with Go and [DataStar](https://data-star.dev). Had to wrap my head around the paradigm shift (I’ve never tried HTMX) and deepen my understanding of Go templates… but now that’s done, I’m loving the simplicity of this stack!! I think it will be my go-to for future personal web apps.
