I was listening to a [Chillout Classics](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcG4kXwIFULb?si=ecbb9a2316f14357) playlist when I was hit with a sense memory from 2006: just lying in my bed listening to Moby, in the middle of the day. I remembered that I would often do this on days where I was hungover, or just feeling a bit lazy. Lie around and listen to music.

It also struck me how it wouldn’t even occur to me today to do such a thing, given I get a moment to myself. Or such a “nothing”. And even if it did, it would feel like I would need a monastic level of self-restraint not to go ahead and add a screen to the mix.

Moments like this want me to run down to the beach and throw my phone in to the ocean.
