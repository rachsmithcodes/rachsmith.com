<p class="date">January 2025</p>

<h2 class="highlighter pink">Notable</h2>

**Extremely offline** could be the theme for this month. While some Australians like to follow find the news coming out of the USA for entertainment or even to satisfy some kind of morbid curiosity, I find it really difficult to read/hear about. After spending some years living there the country and Los Angeles in particular holds such a special place in my heart. I'm finding myself staying offline for the most part in the interest of mental health. It's not like I'm ignorant to what's going on, but I'm not marinating in it.

**Soaking up the summer**. A lot of time was spent with family and friends. Some extra time with my kids who weren't in school/daycare. BBQs, trips to the beach and the lake, all the typical wholesome Coastal town activities. It's been wonderful.

**January fitness shenanigans**. I've done the typical new year new me thing and been super consistent with exercising every day. I think I've landed on a good mix of walking, rebounding, strength, pilates and running and have had no niggles or injuries crop up so far. Crossed fingers it continues!

**I finally saw Wicked!** I saw the musical in Brisbane many years ago and thought it was fine. But something about the movie or maybe seeing it at this stage in my life, I feel like I get now why people are so fanatical about this musical. I loved it!!!

<h2 class="highlighter yellow">Work</h2>

Geez I really hope people use the collaboration feature on the New CodePen Editor because its been a real PITA to get it working smoothly.

**The work soundtrack:** [Wicked: The Soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/album/3JUrJP460nFIqwjxM19slT?si=sB1arErKQe-KMkP7riicRg)

<h2 class="highlighter blue">Watched</h2>

[Palm Royale](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8888540/). Kristen Wiig is my all-time favourite SNL alum so I really wanted to love this show. I just couldn't care enough about the characters or story. Gave up after 2 episodes.

[Severance](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11280740/) Season 1: Finally got around to starting this show after hearing so many people recommend it. Only a few eps in but finding it interesting so far.
