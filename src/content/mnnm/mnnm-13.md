<p class="date">March 2025</p>

The latter half of this month was ruined by me catching Covid (my second time). Boooooooo.

<h2 class="highlighter pink">Notable</h2>

**It was looking like my town was going to be hit by a cyclone** at the start of the month. Thankfully, it downgraded in to a Tropical low before crossing us. We don't typically get cyclones in this part of Queensland, so people were freaking out. Climate change, man.

**I tried a new thing** where I added shorter notes to this site, without a real title. Sometimes I feel like coming up with a title is a barrier to posting, especially if the post is just a little insignificant thought. I feel like my site needs a re-org to accomodate these micro-notes, but for now they just live with the regular ones. It did help me with getting out of a posting drought (before I got sick).

**Covid freaking sucks**. Last time it took me months to get back to normal re: cardiovascular performance. I'm not flu-ey anymore, thank God, but still run down and suffering from the damn brain fog. I am terrified of getting long Covid so I'll put off getting back in to running or anything like that for a bit, incase failing to rest properly increases the chances of prolonging it.

<h2 class="highlighter yellow">Work</h2>

Fixing final bugs and issues for the CodePen Editor. Private beta is so close, I can almost touch it.

<h2 class="highlighter blue">Watched</h2>

[Severance](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11280740/) Season 2. <details>

<summary>Spoiler:</summary>
After finishing the Season 2 finale it occurred to me that I want Gemma to get her happy ending (Outtie Mark), but I also want Mark S to get his happy ending (Helly, and to exist). But there's no way they can both get what they want?! And I guess this unique predicament is what makes the show so good.

</details>

[The White Lotus](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13406094/) Season 3. Finding this season a bit slow. There's a lot of build up/tension without much dramatic pay-off yet. Hope it's all leading to a big satisfying ending.
