      "html": "<p>Hey Kelsey, thanks for your kind words about the site. I didn't end up pursuing a comments solution with supabase. I'm actually working on just using a Netlify form for comment submission and adding the comments to my Astro site as a JSON <a href=\"https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/\" rel=\"nofollow\">content collection</a>. But I have been trying out Supabase with Sveltekit in a little habits app project I'm building for myself. I am loving that combination of tech, they make the data side of getting a web app working really fast.</p>\n",

I love your writing and am grateful you're sharing all your learnings -- technical and otherwise -- with us. This is also simply a beautiful website and a pleasure to scroll through ðŸ’œ<br>\nAbout this post in particular: I see the comments are still hosted with Talkyard. Were you able to try out Supabase and what was your experience with it? I personally have used Firebase for some past projects but am thinking of using Supabase to try something new. Thanks!</p>\n",
