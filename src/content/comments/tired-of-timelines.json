      "html": "<p>Great post; I agree with a lot of the sentiment here.</p>\n<h3>Mastodon</h3>\n<p>When I first got on Mastodon I instantly followed 20-30 hashtags that interested me and every webdev/gamedev I could find (200+). <strong>That ended up being the wrong choice</strong>.</p>\n<p>Since then I've pulled back to 5-6 hashtags, and 20-30 people that I follow. It's made things more meaningful, but can still feel like I'm &quot;shaking my little plan in a stream of information&quot; at times. I'm not sure if I'll stick around but it's mostly been a fun experiment.</p>\n<h3>RSS and Blogging</h3>\n<p>I've been getting into RSS over the last year and love that I get to <em>choose</em> what content I consume, but miss the ease of interaction in general (Your blog has been one of my favourites since I found it a few months back actually.ðŸ™‚). Maybe something new will come along and bridge the gap? I've looked into webmentions but they seem way too technically complicated to get mass adoption.</p>\n<p>I'm relatively new to the whole blogging thing and have been treating it a bit like my own knowledge base; no real direction. Topics include coffee, cooking, coding, technobabble, video games, and a whole bunch of other things I'm interested in. Here's the RSS feed if you're interested: <a href=\"https://mykal.codes/rss.xml\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://mykal.codes/rss.xml</a></p>\n<p>Thanks for the post!</p>\n",

I'm bad at doing this and then I get sad when I think about how I don't have a visual record of anything I've done! Especially from my agency days.</p>\n",
