I remember jumping in my parents Prado immediately after school when we&#39;d go down south for a holiday.</p>\n<p>It&#39;d be a Friday afternoon just before a long weekend, so we&#39;d always be trying to beat the traffic. Inevitably, the freeway would clog, and traffic would come to a slow, meaning the blackness of night would be well and truly set in by the time we ended up at our destination.</p>\n<p>The Prado&#39;s CD player&#39;s eject mechanism was busted, so we only had the discs already stuck in the player to choose from. Moby&#39;s Play was one of those CDs.</p>\n<p>Whenever I listen to the album, it takes me back to being a little kid half-asleep in the backseat of the car as we drove through the Aussie bush while darkness crept in around us and the semi-ethereal sounds of the album played.</p>\n","createdAt":1741675165866}]}
