I would like to do it for externl links on one of my sites. I know that it&#39;s doable, but haven&#39;t undertaken the effort. My only thought on restricting this to internal links is that unless you style those links somewhat differently, visitors to the site might have an expectation that external links would operate similarly and perhaps experience some frustration when they don&#39;t. Anyway, that&#39;s my 2 cents.</p>\n","createdAt":1716049756705}]}
