Small seeds of thoughts can later blossom into a longer post... <em>or not!</em> That&#39;s fine too, and part of the fun of a lighter format.  </p>\n","createdAt":1749143057158},{"id":"68b6af60f806ba00930e57f2","parentId":null,"createdBy":{"fullName":"Torb Lunde Miranda"},"website":"https://www.torb.no","html":"<p>Oh this seems really interesting. I wonder if it&#39;ll be userfriendly enough to use for non-techies  (provided techies set it up for them that is).
