You might want to look into it closer and try to be more specific.</p>\n<p>For myself I identified it as &quot;guilt&quot;. I could be doing something productive instead. I could be spending time with people I care about. I could be reading an interesting book instead. And so on. However, often there&#39;s a legit reason I&#39;m not doing any of that. It&#39;s a day off, I have to get those once in a while. People I care about are far away of busy right now. That interesting book is being delivered but is not here yet. Or there&#39;s no good reason and it&#39;s much easier to switch away from the phone and start doing those other things.</p>\n","createdAt":1716891158278},{"id":"66588dd8f2f3f40369009bdb","parentId":null,"createdBy":{"fullName":"Wilfredo"},"website":"https://www.wilfredoflores.dev","html":"<p><strong>true</strong></p>\n","createdAt":1717079512017}]}
