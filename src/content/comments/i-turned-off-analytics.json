I didn&#39;t track any data for about three years intentionally. Then I thought I would be more motivated to write if I knew people were actually reading my writings. I&#39;m not sure if I made the right decision though. I check my analytics at least five times a day, and it&#39;s certainly a distraction.</p>\n","createdAt":1706589197991},{"id":"65b83ba8eceaf80070297be7","parentId":null,"createdBy":{"fullName":"Addie"},"website":"","html":"<p>New reader here!

I turned off analytics a few years back. It felt like I was pushing unnecessary libraries that harvested unnecessary information on the visitors (and made things slower). Google still sends me a monthly search clicks stat, and that&#39;s all the numbers that I get (from their side)... Is it good? Is it bad? I don&#39;t know... And to be honest, I don&#39;t care that much. It&#39;s nice to know people read the articles, but I would still post updates even if no one read them.</p>\n","createdAt":1706559386908},{"id":"65bb879b77cc3b009c165ca3","parentId":null,"createdBy":{"fullName":"James Cridland"},"website":"https://james.cridland.net","html":"<p>I don&#39;t have analytics on the main website that pays my wages.

I&#39;ve been running my own online educational nonprofit for 10 years (having started without ANY experience with websites, social media, etc).

When I follow the recommendations, it means writing more of the same regurgitated garbage that evermore is littering search results.  </p>\n<p>Yet if one&#39;s mission is to reach people with free, accessible (and actually researched/cited) educational information, how does one &quot;get&quot; to people if not by (at least partially) playing that game.</p>\n<p>For me, digging into analytics has only ever induced angst and a further distancing from my sense of humanity.
