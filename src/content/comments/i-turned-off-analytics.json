I didn&#39;t track any data for about three years intentionally. Then I thought I would be more motivated to write if I knew people were actually reading my writings. I&#39;m not sure if I made the right decision though. I check my analytics at least five times a day, and it&#39;s certainly a distraction.</p>\n","createdAt":1706589197991},{"id":"65b83ba8eceaf80070297be7","parentId":null,"createdBy":{"fullName":"Addie"},"website":"","html":"<p>New reader here! Found you through your interview on Manuel Moreale&#39;s <em>People and Blogs</em>. Really love your down-to-earth writing style on all manner of interesting subjects. Thanks for doing what you do!</p>\n","createdAt":1706572712464},{"id":"65b8079a7a35ff008c99ac1d","parentId":null,"createdBy":{"fullName":"Alvaro"},"website":"https://alvaromontoro.com/","html":"<p>Nice step. I turned off analytics a few years back. It felt like I was pushing unnecessary libraries that harvested unnecessary information on the visitors (and made things slower). Google still sends me a monthly search clicks stat, and that&#39;s all the numbers that I get (from their side)... Is it good? Is it bad? I don&#39;t know... And to be honest, I don&#39;t care that much. It&#39;s nice to know people read the articles, but I would still post updates even if no one read them.</p>\n","createdAt":1706559386908}]}
