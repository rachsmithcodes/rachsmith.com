I generally like movies and usually have a few favorites per year but I haven't been able to get this one out of my head since seeing it in theatres. I think I've seen it 4-5 times at this point, I've shown it to anyone who will watch it with me. The Blu-ray sits on the shelf by my desk and is the only physical movie I own.</p>\n<p>It just feels like it was made for me. I relate to Evelyn, Raymond, and joy throughout. Action is amazing. The weirdness and absurdity of it all is right up my alley.</p>\n<p>I would definitely recommend a second watch after a few weeks. Lots of interesting things to spot the second time around if you're into that sort of thing!</p>\n",
