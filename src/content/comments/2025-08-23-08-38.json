Even back then on modest hardware, this statically typed language had excellent fast and accurate autocomplete (enabled by said types). So I&#39;ve always found people who claim that dynamic language to be better for beginners to be confounding.</p>\n<p>That autocomplete helped me <em>so much</em> in figuring out my early programming days. To this day, I find languages that do not enable this (i.e those that are not dynamically typed)  to feel outright hostile to me.</p>\n<p>Of course, I had to learn JavaScript like everyone else. SQL is fine I suppose. And I&#39;m not going to say that learning a little bit of Scheme and a few chapters from SICP didn&#39;t grow me as a programmer (it did!). But ultimately, I vastly prefer statically typed languages.</p>\n<p>I find TypeScript to be a reasonable compromise, and I imagine pure JavaScript with JSDoc and much better tools could be acceptable to me as well.</p>\n","createdAt":1756802220285}]}
