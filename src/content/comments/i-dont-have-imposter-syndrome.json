      "html": "<p>Early in my career I met an author of a well known python book. We informally were talking in the hallway track about how he was updating this book and I think he made an off-hand comment of, &quot;Should I really be doing this? I don't really know anything.&quot;</p>\n<p>He had already written and published the book. It was popular enough it needed to be updated. But he had a genuine doubt of his skills. It was that moment that made me realize that if he could honestly feel that way, my doubt was probably also unwarranted.</p>\n<p>I've had moments like this, where I had a boss gaslighting me into thinking I wasn't good enough. I'm privileged enough to be able to quickly change jobs and find a better fit where this isn't the case. I absolutely agree with you though, I don't know that I've really had imposter syndrome.</p>\n<p>But I definitely like my anecdote.</p>\n",
