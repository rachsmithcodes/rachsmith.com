      "html": "<p>hi Martin. I don't really consider this as tracking for my employer, compared to when I used to have track in an agency environment, where every minute had to be tracked and keeping your billable hours up was a real concern. I don't actually have to send any details to CodePen, all they need from me is a number at the end of the month. I choose to use daily tracking to come up with that number for my own peace of mind but theoretically I could just make a number up. Thanks for your comment!</p>\n",
