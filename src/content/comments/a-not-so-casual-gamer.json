There are a few really good ones out there. I sugges sudoku because they’re a little bit more demanding. I’ve noticed that after three or four games I get tired and leave it unlike match-tree type games. It’s still enjoyable and rewarding but uch easier to quit and doesn’t take that much time.</p>\n","createdAt":1706364069107},{"id":"65b441aa32aae70082652475","parentId":null,"createdBy":{"fullName":"cuibonobo"},"website":"https://cuibonobo.com","html":"<p>I&#39;m so glad you posted this.

I spend a lot of time lately in Homescapes and Souls. I just deleted ALL games from my phone except Good Soduko (I usually don&#39;t spend much time here). Got rid of Geometry, Homescapes, Warcraft Rumble, Souls, Survivor.io and The Tower.
