Inspired by this article, I just implemented my own AI-moderated Astro comment system.</p>\n<p>An SSR script adds saves comments temporarily to a Vercel DB (and displays the comment to the person posting immediately). </p>\n<p>Then, periodically, a cron grabs the new DB posts sends them to OpenAI for moderation and then merges the ai-approved comments into Github (using an Astro data-collection for comment JSON files).

I appreciate how you found a way to maintain the efficiency and simplicity of static site generation while incorporating a comment system. The use of Netlify forms and a custom approval app is a clever approach.</p>\n<h2>Some Thoughts</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Netlify Forms:</strong> Great choice for handling form submissions without adding much overhead.</li>\n<li><strong>SvelteKit App:</strong> Clever way to review and approve comments.</li>\n<li><strong>Static Site Generation:</strong> Maintaining SSG while adding comments is impressive.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Have you considered using a headless CMS to manage the comments? It might offer a more streamlined way to handle content updates and approvals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Future Enhancements</h3>\n<p>I would like to see a similar way to do it without relying on Netlify </p>\n<p>Thanks for sharing your process! Looking forward to seeing how this evolves.</p>\n","createdAt":1723069851909}]}
