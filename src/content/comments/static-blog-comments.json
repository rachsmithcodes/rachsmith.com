That is a smart approach! Nice to not need third party comments or host your own server. I feel like it would be nice to not have to commit the repo manually for every comment tho, but it sounds like it could be possible with the Api..:)</p>\n","createdAt":1706087974115},{"id":"65c39747cc3a34008959f2d1","parentId":null,"createdBy":{"fullName":"Chad"},"website":"https://bahai-education.org","html":"<p>Thank you! Inspired by this article, I just implemented my own AI-moderated Astro comment system.</p>\n<p>An SSR script adds saves comments temporarily to a Vercel DB (and displays the comment to the person posting immediately). </p>\n<p>Then, periodically, a cron grabs the new DB posts sends them to OpenAI for moderation and then merges the ai-approved comments into Github (using an Astro data-collection for comment JSON files). Merging into Github triggers a rebuild/redeploy on Vercel.  </p>\n<p>Fully static Astro site with comments and AI comment moderation. </p>\n","createdAt":1707317063832},{"id":"65bd381e3b668a008c36f0b0","parentId":null,"createdBy":{"fullName":"Mia"},"website":"","html":"<p>Awesome tip for getting comments working with a static site.
