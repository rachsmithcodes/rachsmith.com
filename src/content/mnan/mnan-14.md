<p class="date">May 2025</p>

This month's update is a little ode to the practice of journaling. Part way through April I caught gastro ðŸ˜­ and in this moment of weakness [I downloaded Royal Kingdom from the App Store](/a-not-so-casual-gamer/). I got sucked in to the matching vortex and went in to the ol' shame spiral about all the hours lost, again.

So when it came to the end of the month I didn't want to even make this note because according to my brain I had frittered the entire thing away building a Royal Kingdom. However, after consulting my (very brief) journal entries I recalled that we went on a whole-ass holiday to the Gold Coast, created lots of mems with extended family at Easter time, and I deep cleaned whole sections of the house. It felt like all of that happened months ago, not weeks! I probably got less creative practice in, but I had not in fact ruined my life.

So, shout out to my journal. And, NO THANKS to my catastrophising, hyper-critical inner narrative.

<h2 class="highlighter yellow">Work</h2>

Squashing bugs.

**The work soundtrack:** [Forever (with Kid Cudi) Radio](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E8OKLKVsZRmdI?si=109641a891db428c)

<h2 class="highlighter blue">Watched</h2>

[The White Lotus](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13406094/) Season 3. Disappointed with this one. Felt like the decisions made by key characters in the last two episodes were just too stupid.

[The Last Anniversary](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30150289/). Really enjoyed the Australian-ness of this show after watching a lot of US-based series lately.

<h2 class="highlighter green">Played</h2>

[Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_Country:_Tropical_Freeze). I was looking for another 2D platformer, as they are my favourite kind of game to play. This was really fun!
