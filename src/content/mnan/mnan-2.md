<p class="date">February 2024</p>

I am now two months in to my attempt to [journal every day](/my-goal-for-2024/), and I am pleased to report I have _something_ on each daily page in my Hobonichi so far.

<h2 class="highlighter pink">Notable</h2>

**I've been really focusing on home and family related stuff this month**. One of my kids had a birthday, and we have a massive USA trip looming at the end of March, so I've been list-making, planning and prepping.

**I went through a period of fixation on home organisation and cleaning.** This happens about once a year. I cleared out a few cupboards, sold some stuff on Marketplace (or gave it away), and improved some processes in the kitchen. I researched some [different](https://cleanmama.com/start-here/) [cleaning](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/cleaning/a31915249/fly-lady-cleaning-schedule/) [methods](https://www.theorganisedmum.blog/), but concluded they all involve spending too much time on cleaning. So I just waited for the fixation to pass and now I don't care about the state of the house again ðŸ˜Š.

A side-effect of all this focus on home life is that I've **published shit-all on this site**. Oh well.

Last month, I went hard on working out and running, and finished with a hamstring injury. I went to the physio and she told me (in a much nicer way) that **I had absolutely no business running those distances on my weak-ass glutes** (weak-ass ass?). So I've been doing the rehab exercises. It's like **every day is leg day** with the same boring routine, but I am seeing an improvement and should be back to running soon.

**I made a real effort to read more and scroll less**, after noting my abysmal reading count in last month's numbers. I ended up finishing three books. I plan to post a little review of the books I read this year, I just need to finish adding a custom note type for book reviews.

<h2 class="highlighter yellow">Work</h2>

We are so close to showing people what we've been calling "CodePen 2.0" internally. It's still early days but like no one outside of the team has seen my work for a long, long time. So that's exciting.

**The work soundtrack:** [It's the D.O double G](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6VprUnfeLcL4gsg57DHTyj?si=df64cefebb4645c4)

<h2 class="highlighter blue">Watched</h2>

[Five Bedrooms](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9755726/). Finished Season 3 and then took a break because I'd lost interest. Cheating storylines are boring.

[Fargo Season 5](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2802850/). I'm a Juno Temple fan. All the acting in this season was really good. Loved the finale episode. Glad I came back to this series after being underwhelmed with Season 3 and skipping Season 4.
