<p class="date">August 2025</p>

<h2 class="highlighter pink">Notable</h2>

**I turned 39!**. A pretty low-key birthday, but overall I'm feeling really good about things in my life at the moment. I went to watch [Freakier Friday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freakier_Friday) at the cinema with my sister to celebrate, lol.

**I completed my goal running time**. I had a goal to (comfortably) run 5km in under 30 minutes, and I did it this month! Training is underway for the next goal: 10km in under an hour.

**I got an iPad mini** for my birthday, with an Apple Pencil Pro. I've been using it for [drawing](https://bsky.app/profile/rachsmith.com/post/3lvwhvfjmi32q) and (digital) colouring. I'm low-key obsessed with this device. It's perfect as a digital notebook.

**Swapped gaming for website making**. A friend asked if I could make his business a simple brochure site. It's not like I have any spare time for a second job but I decided I'll just spend the time I normally would spend playing Switch, designing and building the site. I think I'll make a separate post about this experience but I'm really enjoying myself!

<h2 class="highlighter yellow">Work</h2>

Mostly dealing lots of bugs / [that last 10%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety%E2%80%93ninety_rule).

<h2 class="highlighter blue">Watched</h2>

[High Potential](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22091076/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) Season 1. I was invested by the end of the season. They ended on quite a cliff-hanger! I think I like this show because it is reminiscent of [Numb3rs](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433309/).

[The Family Next Door](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Family_Next_Door_(Australian_TV_series)>). Another Australian mystery-drama set in a Coastal Town. Worth it just for the beach shots.

<h2 class="highlighter green">Read</h2>

[Crown of Midnight](https://sarahjmaas.com/throne-of-glass-series/) (Throne of Glass series, Book 2) by Sarah J. Maas. Enjoying this more than Book 1!
