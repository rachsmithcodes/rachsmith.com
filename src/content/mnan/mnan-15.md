<p class="date">June & July 2025</p>

It's funny that in the <a href="/mnan/14/">last update</a> I wrote about how great my journaling practice is for remembering things, and then life got so busy I stopped the daily journaling. Now two months have passed somehow and I don't know how it happened so fast or what occurred. Thankfully I'm back in the habit this month!

<h2 class="highlighter pink">Notable</h2>

**The June/July period of the year is hectic**. Family/social/school commitments ramp up and there's a stretch of school holidays in there as well. It's all great but doesn't leave much time for updating this site or noodling on the computer.

**I had a new-found burst of work motivation**. I've been working on the same product for 4 years, wondering if it will ever ship. And for the first time I can see a release at the end of the tunnel. So that has got me jazzed for work again.

**I joined a social netball team**
It is really fun, except for when we play 13 year old girls and I just about die trying to keep up.

**My sleep has randomly gone to shit**. I'm waking up in the night overthinking things all of a sudden?! I'm gonna guess it is some hormonal/perimenopause bullshit because the only other time in my life I've experienced this when I was pregnant. It sucks!!

<h2 class="highlighter yellow">Work</h2>

I'm not sure if we've talked much about this publicly yet but the new CodePen Editor will have a Version history feature. Saving every version of every Pen is a LOT of data to keep, so I've mostly be concerned with the rollup algorithm and background jobs that clean up data and leaves something useful behind.

<h2 class="highlighter blue">Watched</h2>

[High Potential](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22091076/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1), [Dying for Sex](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30252752/) and [Running Point](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14879018/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1). Watched some episodes of all of these. They were... just fine. Happy to keep putting them on when I feel like a show at the end of the day but it's not like I'm desperate to finish the Season for any of them.

[Happy Gilmore 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31868189/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1). Loved the original, and this one was great too. I like when they shamelessly just make the same movie again for sequels of comedies: like [Anchorman 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1229340/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) or [22 Jump Street](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294449/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_6_nm_2_in_0_q_22%2520). I liked the first version, so definitely just give me more of the same!

<h2 class="highlighter green">Played</h2>

[Mario & Luigi: Brothership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_%26_Luigi:_Brothership). It took me soooo long to finish the story of this game!! I wasn't even enjoying myself for the last 20 hours, but I couldn't walk away from it because I'm a completionist who can't move on from sunk costs.

[Super Mario 3D World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_3D_World) + Bowser's Fury. Super fun game, might be up there in my top 5 Switch games!

<h2 class="highlighter orange">Read</h2>

[Baggage](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57931617-baggage) by Alan Cumming. Great memoir in which Alan drops some quite profound observations about life and relationships. I think if you work in the biz you would be annoyed by how blessed/lucky his career trajectory was lol.

[The Source](https://www.taraswart.com/the-source/) by Tara Swart. I was intrigued after hearing Tara on a podcast, but this book turned out to be [mostly all the things I've read before](/the-diminishing-returns-of-self-dev-content/).

[Throne of Glass](https://sarahjmaas.com/throne-of-glass-series/) by Sarah J. Maas. I decided it was time to delve in to another fantasy series after reading the Mistborn Trilogy last year. This is YA I think so a bit easier to read, and easier to read a chapter or two at a time.

**No numbers this month** as they are part of my journaling habit. When that dropped, so did the tracking.
