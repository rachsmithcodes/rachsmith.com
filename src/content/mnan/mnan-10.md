<p class="date">November & December 2024</p>

I haven't been too online the last two months because things have been really busy offline. It's good busy - no issues or dramas but the School year ending and lead up to Christmas involves a lot of preparation, organising and socialising.

<h2 class="highlighter pink">Notable</h2>

**Christmas**. Christmas has been a bit tricky for me since my mum passed from a brain tumour, just after Christmas 2011. I was just sad for many years, until I had my own kids and then I was kind of bummed about the fact I was the one doing the work to make Christmas special, and I will never have the person who did it for me back again. Anyway, it is probably because my kids are old enough to truly appreciate what is happening, but I really, really enjoyed Christmas prep and celebrations this year! I wasn't sad at all - for the first time in a long, long time.

**Summer holidays**. Lots of catch ups with friends and extended family. It has been awesome.

**I started reformer pilates**. I took this up because I couldn't run anymore on the ankle injury. I'm loving it so far, and will keep it up even when I get back to running I think.

**I got back in to daily piano practice**. Had a break there for a while. I'm doing the Atomic Habits thing again where I just try to do 10-15min of the things I want to consistently do each day, one of them being piano. It's working - the small time commitment feels less overwhelming.

<h2 class="highlighter yellow">Work</h2>

We're at the stage with our New Editor where we're just trying to knock out those nasty little bugs that are left over in the final 5% of the project. So I've just been attempting (and failing most of the time) to squash them.

**The work soundtrack:** [Messy Radio](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E8OPe69gikoeO?si=bFB30nAsTJaHRy3u-1HVsw&pi=a-DwcqWnDaTU6O)

<h2 class="highlighter blue">Watched</h2>

[Shrinking](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15677150/) Season 2: I wish they were a little less melodramatic and a little more funny in this season. The last episode had me bawling ðŸ˜­.

[The Sex Lives of College Girls](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11212276/) Season 3: Only a few episodes in to this season. It's been slow to get going because they had to write out ReneÃ© Rapp. Love her as an actress but the character was my least favourite of the 4 so looking forward to seeing what they do without her.
