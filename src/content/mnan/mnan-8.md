<p class="date">August 2024</p>

It was a kinda-off month in terms of mental health, which I'm still blaming on just one big day of drinking back in July. Feeling much better now in September!

<h2 class="highlighter pink">Notable</h2>

**I turned 38**. Kind of a nothing birthday. I did get to go out for an afternoon with my sister and some besties so that was nice.

**I did a [Ken Barber](https://typeandlettering.com/) lettering workshop**. I've been wanting to do one of these for ages, but with the USD -> AUD the pricing was kind of absurd, so I requested it for my birthday. Loved it! I feel like my letter-forms have improved heaps already.

**I was doing a lot of coding for fun.** I was building out a reporting web app for our YNAB data using the [YNAB API](https://api.ynab.com/), [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). It is probably something that could be made with a spreadsheet but I just love using JavaScript. It's been a while since I was inspired to code outside of my day job. I'm enjoying this phase!

<h2 class="highlighter yellow">Work</h2>

Split my time between upgrading our billing and payments system at [CodePen](https://codepen.io), as well as QA work for the new Editor.

**The work soundtrack:** [hot girl sh\*t](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWSnLm8DcIg6D?si=e2ec2a06dcff45b0)

<h2 class="highlighter blue">Watched</h2>

Back on [The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5788792/) Season 3.
